    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
Oh Bridget O'Malley you left my heart shaken
With a hopeless desolation I'd have you to know
It's the wonders of admiration your quiet face has taken
And your beauty will haunt me wherever I go
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
The white Moon above the pale sands, the pale stars above the thorn tree
Are cold beside my darling but no purer than she
I gaze upon the cold moon, till the stars drown in the warm sea
And the bright eyes of my darling are never on me
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
My Sunday is weary, my Sunday it is grey now
My heart is a cold thing, my heart is a stone
All joy is dead in me, my life has gone away now
Another has taken my love for his own
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
The day it is approaching, when we were to be married
And it's rather I would die than live only to grieve
Oh meet me my darling ere the sunsets o'er the barley
And I'll meet you there on the road to Drumsleey
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>
Oh Bridget O'Malley you left my heart shaken
With a hopeless desolation I'd have you to know
It's the wonders of admiration your quiet face has taken
And your beauty will haunt me wherever I go
</lines>
