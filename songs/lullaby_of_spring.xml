  <lyrics>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
Rain has showered far her drip
Splash and trickle running
Plant has flowered in the sun
Shell and pebble sunning
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>
So begins another spring
Green leaves and of berries
Chiff-chaff eggs are painted by
Mother-bird eating cherries
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
In a misty tangled sky
Fast a wind is blowing
In a newborn rabbit's heart
River life is flowing
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
From the dark and whetted soil
Petals are unfolding
From the stony village kirk
Easter bells of old rings
</lines>
    </verse>
