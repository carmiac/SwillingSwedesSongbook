    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
Well, come on Viking, don't be lax
put on your tunic and grab your ax
We're goin' down to our dragon ships
gonna skewer some Saxons on our spear-tips
We know we won't all be comin' back,
but it's so fun to slash and hack!
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>
And it's 1-2-3, who are fightin' for?
I know, it don't matter at all,
next stop is Odin's hall!
And it's 5-6-7, headin' for the rainbow bridge,
well, we love to fight, and that's no lie,
whoopee, we're all gonna die!
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
Well we know dyin' ain't so tough,
that's what makes us so mean and rough
We know that when we kick off
we'll be drinkin' good beer right out of a trough
And grabbin' Valkyries by their bums
and the hangover never comes!
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
So, you grab Oly and I'll get Sven
the spring is here, it's time to raid again
Let's steal the cattle and burn the huts
and toss the women right on their butt's!
And we'll have a good time and maybe we'll croak,
but who cares, let's go make some smoke!
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
Well, Vikings are bad boys to the core
even our poems are full of gore
We like squishing intestines with our feet
we think slaughter is really neat!
Because fightin' and killin' pleases our gods,
so hey, you can't beat the odds!
