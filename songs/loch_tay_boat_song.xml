    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
When I'm done the work of day
And I row my boat away
Dawn the waters of Loch Tay
When the evening light is fallen
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
Then I look towards Ben Lass
Where the after glories glow
And I dream of two bright eyes
Where the Mary Mirth glow
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
She's my beauteous Maiden Loch
She's my Joy and Sorrow too
Though I own she is not true
Ah, but I cannot live without her
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
For my heart's a boat in two
And I'd give the world to know
If she means to let me go
As I send me slowly home
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>
And in Loch her loving hair
Has more beauty I declare
Then all the tresses fair
From Cildain to Aber Felde
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>
Be they lent, white, gold, or brown
Be they blacker than the sloe
They meant not as much to me
As a meltin' flake of snow
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v7">
      <lines>
And her dance is like the gleam
Of the sunlight on the stream
And the songs that we folk sing
Oh they're songs that she sings milkin'
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v8">
      <lines>
But my heart is full of woe
For last night she bade me go
And the tears began to flow
As I silently go home
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v9">
      <lines>
When I'm done the work of day
And I row my boat away
Dawn the waters of Loch Tay
When the evening light is fallen
</lines>
