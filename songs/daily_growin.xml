    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
Trees they grow high, and leaves they do grow green
Many is the time my true love I've seen
Many an hour I've watched him run along
He's young but he's daily growin'
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
Father, dear father, you've done me great wrong
You've married me to a boy who is too young
'Though I'm twice twelve, he is but fourteen
He's young but he's daily growin'
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
Daughter, dear daughter, I've done you no wrong
I've married you to a brave lords son
He'll be a man to you when I'm dead and gone
He's young but he's daily growin'
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
Father, dear father, if you'll see fit
We'll send my love to college for one year yet
I'll tie blue ribbons, all around his head
To let the ladies know, he's mine
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>
As I was looking over my fathers castle wall
Saw the young boys, a playing at the ball
My own true love was the flower of them all
He's young but he's daily growin'
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>
At the age of fourteen he was a married man
Age of fifteen he held his son in his hands
Age of sixteen, on his grave the grass was green
Cruel Death had put an end to his growin'
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v7">
      <lines>
I make my love a shroud of the Harlan so fine
Every stitch I put in it the tears come a tricklin' down
Once I had a true love, but now he is gone
But I'll watch o'er his son while he's growin'
</lines>
