    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
There was a youth and a well beloved youth
And he was a squire's son;
He loved the bailiff's daughter dear,
That lived in Islington.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
Yet she was coy and would not believe.
That he did love her so,
No, nor at any time would she
Any countenance to him show.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
But when his friends did understand,
His fond and foolish mind,
They sent him up to fair London town,
An apprentice for to bind.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
And when he had been seven long years,
And never his love could see;
"Many a tear have I shed for her sake
When she little thought of me.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>
Then all the maids of Islington
Went forth to sport and play;
All but the bailiff's daughter dear,
She secretly stole away.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>
She pulled off her gown of green,
And put on some ragged attire;
And to fair London she would go,
Her true love to inquire.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v7">
      <lines>
And as she went along the high road,
The weather being hot and dry,
She sat her down upon a green bank
And her true love came riding by.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v8">
      <lines>
She started up with a color so red,
Catching hold of his bridle rein;
"One penny, one penny, kind sir," she said,
"Will ease me of much pain."
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v9">
      <lines>
"Before I give you one penny fair maid,
Pray tell me where you were born."
"At Islington, kind sir," said she,
"Where I have had many a scorn.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v10">
      <lines>
If that be so, I prithee, fair maid,
Oh, tell me whether you know
The bailiff's daughter of Islington?"
"She is dead, sir, long ago."
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v11">
      <lines>
"If she be dead, then take my horse,
My saddle and bridle also;
For I will into some far country
Where no man shall me know.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v12">
      <lines>
"Oh stay, oh stay, thou goodly youth,
She standeth by thy side;
She is here alive, she is
And ready to be thy bride."
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v13">
      <lines>
Oh, farewell grief and welcome joy
Ten thousand times therefore;
For now I have found my own true love,
Whom I tho't I never should see more."
</lines>
