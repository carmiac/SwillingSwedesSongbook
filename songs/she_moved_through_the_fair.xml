    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
My young love said to me, &quot;My mother won't mind
and my father won't slight you for your lack of kind,&quot;
And she stepped away from me and this she did say,
&quot;It will not be long love, till our wedding day.&quot;
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
She stepped away from me and went thro' the fair,
And fondly I watch'd her move here and move there,
And then she went homeward with one star awake,
As the swan in the evening moving over the lake.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
The people were saying, no two e'er were wed
But one had a sorrow that never was said
And I smiled as she passed with her goods and her gear,
And that was the last that I saw of my dear.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
Last night she came to me, she came softly in,
So softly she came that her feet make no din.
And she laid her hand on me and this she did say,
&quot;It will not be long, love, till our wedding day.&quot;
