    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
A grazing mace, how sweet the sound, that felled a foe for me
I bashed his head, he struck the ground, and thus came victory
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
My mace has taught my foes to fear, that mace my fears relieved
How precious did my mace appear, when I my mace received
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
Through many tourneys, wars, and fairs, I have already come
My mace has brought me safe so far, my mace will bring me home
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
The King has promised good to me, His word my hope secures
I will his Shield and Weapon be, when He gives me my spurs
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>
And when my mace my foeman nails, that mortal strife shall cease
And we'll possess within our pale, a life of joy and peace
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>
A grazing mace, how sweet the sound, that flattened a wretch like thee
Whose head is flat, that once was round done in by my mace...And me!
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v7">
      <lines>
A grazing mace, how sweet the sound that smites a foe like thee
You're left there lying on the ground, you've left the field to me!
</lines>
