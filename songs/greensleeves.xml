    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
Alas my love, you do me wrong
To cast me off discourteously,
And I have loved you so long,
Delighting in your company.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>
Greensleeves was all my joy,
Greensleeves was my delight;
Greensleeves was my heart of gold,
And who but Lady Greensleeves?
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
I have been ready at your hand,
To grant whatever you would crave;
I have both waged life and land,
Your love and good will for to have.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
I bought thee kerchiefs for thy head,
That were wrought fine and gallantly;
I kept thee both at board and bed,
Which cost my purse well favorably.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
I bought thee petticoats of the best,
The cloth so fine as fine might be;
I gave thee jewels for thy chest,
And all this cost I spent on thee.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>
Thy smock of silk, both fair and white,
With gold embroidered gorgeously,
Thy petticoat of Sendall right,
And this I bought thee gladly.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>
Thy girdle of the gold so red,
With pearls bedecked sumptuously,
The like no other lasses had,
And yet thou wouldst not love me.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v7">
      <lines>
Thy purse and also thy gay gilt knives,
Thy pincase gallant to the eye;
No better wore the Burgesse wives,
And yet thou wouldst not love me.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v8">
      <lines>
Thy crimson stockings all of silk,
With gold all wrought above the knee,
Thy pumps as white as was the milk,
And yet thou wouldst not love me.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v9">
      <lines>
Thy gown was of the glossy green,
Thy sleeves of satin hanging by,
Which made thee be our Harvest Queen,
And yet thou wouldst not love me.
</lines>
