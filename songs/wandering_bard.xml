    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
Chill the wintry winds were blowing,
Foul the murky night was snowing,
Through the storm the minstrel, bowing,
Sought the inn on yonder moor.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
All within was warm and cheery,
All without was cold and dreary,
There the wand'rer, old and weary,
Thought to pass the night secure.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
Softly rose his mournful ditty,
Suiting to his tale of pity;
But the master, scoffing, witty,
Check'd Inns strain with scornful jeer:
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
&quot;Hoary vagrant, frequent comer,
Canst thou guide thy gains of summer?--
No, thou old intruding thrummer,
Thou canst have no lodging here.&quot;
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>
Slow the bard departed, sighing;
Wounded worth forbade replying;
One last feeble effort trying,
Faint he sunk no more to rise.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>
Through his harp the breeze sharp ringing,
Wild his dying dirge was singing,
While his soul, from insult springing,
Sought its mansion in the skies.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v7">
      <lines>
Now, though wintry winds be blowing,
Night be foul, with raining, snowing,
Still the trav'ller, that way going,
Shuns the inn upon the moor
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v8">
      <lines>
Though within 'tis warm and cheery,
Though without 'tis cold and dreary,
Still he minds the minstrel weary,
Spurn'd from that unfriendly door.
</lines>
