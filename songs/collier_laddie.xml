    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
Oh, I've been east and I've been west,
And I've been to Kirkcaldy;
But the bonniest lassie that ever I saw,
She was following a collier laddie.

    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
" Oh where live ye my bonnie lass?
And tell me what they ca'ye?"
" Bonnier Jeanie Gordon is my name,
And I'm following my collier laddie."
</lines>

    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
" O, see ye not yon hills and dales
The sun shines on saw brawlie;
They a'are mine, and they'll be thine,
Gin ye'll leave your collier laddie.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
And ye shall bask in gay attire,
Weel busket up sae brawlie;
And ane to wait on ev'ry hand,
Gin ye'll leave your collier laddie.:
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>
" Tho ye had a the sun shines on,
And the earth conceals sae lowly,
I would turn my back on you and it a',
And embrace my collier laddie.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>
O, I can win my five pennies a day,
And spend at night fu'brawlie;
And make my bed in the collier's neuk,
And lie doon wi'my collier laddie."
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v7">
      <lines>
O, love for love's the bargain for me,
Tho the wee cot house should haud me;
And the world before me to win my bread,
And fair fa'my collier laddie."
