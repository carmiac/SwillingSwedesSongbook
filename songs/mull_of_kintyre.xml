      <lines>
Mull of Kintyre, Oh Mists rolling in from the sea
My Desire is always to be here, Oh, Mull of Kintyre
Far I have traveled and much I have seen
Far distant mountains with valleys of green
Vast painted deserts with sunsets on fire
As he carries me home to the Mull of Kintyre
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
Mull of Kintyre, Oh Mists rolling in from the sea
My Desire is always to be here, On Mull of Kintyre
Sweet through the heather, right here in the glen
Carry me back to the days I knew when
Nights when we sang like a heavenly choir
Oh the Knights and the times of the Mull of Kintyre
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
Mull of Kintyre, Oh Mists rolling in from the sea
My Desire is always to be here, Oh, Mull of Kintyre
Smiles in the sunshine and tears in the rain
Still takes me back where my memories remain
Flickering embers grow higher and higher
As they carry me back to the Mull of Kintyre
</lines>
