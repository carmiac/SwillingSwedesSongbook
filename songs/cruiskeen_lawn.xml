      <lines>
Let the farmer praise his grounds,
Let the huntsman praise his hounds,
And the shepherd his sweet scented lambs
But I, more blest than they,
Spend each happy night and day with my charming little
Cruiskeen lawn, lawn, lawn!
Oh, my charming little Cruiskeen lawn'

Gram-ma-chree ma Cruiskeen,
Slain-te geal ma-vour-neen,
Gra-ma-chree a coolin bawn, bawn bawn!
Ah, gra-ma-chree a coolin bawn!

      <lines>
Immortal and divine, great Bacchus, god of wine
Create me by adoption your son.
In hopes that you'll comply, That my glass shall ne'er run dry
Nor my smilin' little
Cruiskeen lawn, lawn, lawn!
Oh, my smiling little Cruiskeen lawn'
</lines>

    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
And when grim Death appears, in a few but pleasant years,
To tell me that my glass has run,
I'll say, &quot;Begone, you knave! For great Bacchus gave me leave
To take another
Cruiskeen lawn, lawn, lawn!
To take another Cruiskeen lawn'

Little jug, my heart's love,
Bright health to my own dove;
Little Jug, my own heart's love, love, love,
Oh! Little jug, my own heart's love!
