    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
Hey, Johnnie Cope, are you wauking yet?
Or are your drums a-beating yet?
If ye were wauking I wad wait
To gang to the coals in the morning
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
Cope sent a challenge frae Dunbar
&quot;Charlie meet me an ye daur,
An I'll learn you the art o' war
If you'll meet me in the morning&quot;
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
When Charlie looked the letter upon,
He drew his sword the scabbard from
&quot;Come follow me, my merry men,
An' we'll meet Johnnie Cope in the morning!&quot;
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
&quot;Now Johnnie, be as good as your word
Come, let us try both fire and sword
And dinna rin like a frightened bird
That's chased frae it's nest in the morning&quot;
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>
When Johnnie Cope he heard of this
He thought it wad'na be amiss
To hae his horse in readiness
To flee awa' in the morning
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>
Fly now Johnnie, get up and rin
The Highlands bagpipes make a din
It's best to sleep in a hale skin
For 'Twill be a bluidy morning
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v7">
      <lines>
When Johnnie cope to Dunbar came
They sneered at him, &quot;Where's a' your men?&quot;
&quot;The Deil confound me gin I ken
For I left them a' in the morning
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v8">
      <lines>
Now Johnnie, Troth, ya are na blate
To come wi' the news o' your ain defeat
And leave your men in sae a strait
Sae early in the morning
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v9">
      <lines>
&quot;I' faith&quot; quo Johnnie &quot; I got a fleg
Wi' their claymores and phillabegs
If I face them again, Deil break my legs!
Else I wish you a gud morning&quot;
</lines>
