    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
The gypsy rover came over the hill,
Bound through the valley so shady;
He whistled and he sang till the green woods rang,
And he won the heart of a lady.

    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>
Lah-Dee-o, Lah-Dee-O-ah-day,
Lay-dee-o, Lah dee ay dee.
He whistled and he sang until the green woods rang,
And he won the heart of a lady.

    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
She left her father's castle gate,
She left her own true lover;
She left her servants and her estate,
To follow the gypsy rover.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
Her father saddled his fastest steed,
He roam'd the valley all over;
He sought his daughter at great speed,
And the whistling gypsy rover.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
He came at last to a mansion fine,
Down by the river Claydee;
And there was music, and there was wine,
For the gypsy and his lady.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>
&quot;O, father he's no gypsy free,
But lord of these lands all over;
And I will stay till my dying day,
With my whistling gypsy rover.&quot;
