    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
On the east end of town, by the foot of the hill
There's a chimney so tall, says Belfast Mill
But there's no smoke at all comin' out of the stack
For the mill has shut down, and it's never comin' back
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>
And the only tune I hear is the sound of the wind
As she blows through the town, we then spin, we then spin
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
There's no children playin' down the dark lonely streets
For the mill has shut down, so quiet I can't sleep
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
The mill has shut down, 'twas the only life I know
Tell me where will I go, tell me where will I go
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
Well I'm to old to work, and I'm too young to die
Tell me where will I go, my family and I
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>
At the east end of town, by the foot of the hill
There's a chimney so tall, says Belfast Mill
But there's no smoke at all comin' out of the stack
For the mill has shut down, and it's never comin' back
</lines>
