    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
I am a babe, an only babe,
Fire and water and all,
Who in my mother's womb was made,
Great Alta take my soul.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
But from that mother I was torn,
Fire and water and all,
And to a hillside I was borne,
Great Alta take my soul.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
And on that hillside I was laid,
Fire and water and all,
And taken up all by a maid,
Great Alta save my soul.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
And one and two and three we rode?
Fire and water and all,
Till others took the heavy load,
Great Alta take my soul.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>
Let all good women hark to me,
Fire and water and all,
For fostering shall set thee free,
Great Alta save my soul.
</lines>
