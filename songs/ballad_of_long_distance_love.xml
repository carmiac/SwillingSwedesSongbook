    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
Oh my lady is fair as the morning
oh my lady is sweet as the dew
But my lady dwells in far Atlantia
So I'll sleep at Estrella with you
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
Oh her smile is as bright as the sunrise
And her voice like a nightingale's song
I would fly to her side in an instant
If the journey were not quite so long
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
Oh my lady is gentle and lovely
Thoughts of her warm my heart, it is true
But my lady's not here at Outlandish
So I'll dance by the fire for you
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
Oh her laughter is like sweetest music
And her green eyes like emeralds shine bright
I am certain that she will be grateful
That you kept me from freezing last night
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>
Oh my lady is surely an angel
Twas pure torture to bid her adieu
But she could not fly her to this mountain
So I'll go to the hot springs with you
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>
Oh I carry her favor in battle
For her honor I gladly would die
But if she can't make it to Pennsic
I'm not gonna sit down and cry
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v7">
      <lines>
Oh my lady is fair as the morning
With a voice like a nightingale's song
I would fly to her side in an instant
If the journey were not quite so long
</lines>
