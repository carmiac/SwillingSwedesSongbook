    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
As I was walking all alane,
I heard twa corbies making a mane:
The tane unto the tither did say,
Whar sall we gang and dine the day?'
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
In behint yon auld fail dyke
I wot there lies a new-slain knight;
And naebody kens that he lies there
But his hawk, his hound, and his lady fair.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
His hound is to the hunting gane,
His hawk to fetch the wild-fowl hame,
His lady's ta'en anither mate,
So we may mak' our dinner sweet.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
Ye'll sit on his white hause-bane,
And I'll pike out his bonny blue e'en:
Wi' ae lock o' his gowden hair
We'll theek our nest when it grows bare.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>
Mony a one for him maks mane,
But nane sall ken whar he is gane:
O'er his white banes, when they are bare,
The wind sall blaw for evermair.
</lines>
