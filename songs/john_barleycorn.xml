    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
There were three men come out of the West
Their fortunes for to try,
And these three men made a solemn vow:
John Barleycorn should die!
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
They plowed, they sowed, they harrowed him in,
Threw clods upon his head,
And these three men made a solemn vow:
John Barleycorn was dead!
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
They let him lie for a very long time
'Til the rain from Heaven did fall,
Then Little Sir John sprung up his head,
And so amazed them all!
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
They let him stand 'til Midsummer tide,
'Til he grew both pale and wan,
Then Little Sir John he grew a long beard,
And so became a man!
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>
They hired men with the scythes so sharp
To cut him off at the knee
They rolled him and tied him about the waist,
And used him barbarously!
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>
They hired men with the sharp pitchforks
To pierce him to the heart,
And the loader he served him worse than that,
For he tied him in a cart!
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v7">
      <lines>
They wheeled him around and around the field,
'Til they came to a barn,
And there they made a solemn mow
Of poor John Barleycorn,
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v8">
      <lines>
They hired men with the crab-tree sticks
To strip him skin from bone
And the Miller he served him worse than that:
For he ground him between two stones!
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v9">
      <lines>
Here's Little Sir John in a nut-brown bowl,
And brandy in a glass!
And Little Sir John in the nut-brown bowl
Proved the stronger man at last!
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v10">
      <lines>
For the huntsman he can't hunt the fox
Nor loudly blow his horn,
And the tinker can't mend kettles nor pots
Without John Barleycorn!
</lines>
    </verse>
