    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
I am a young sailor, my story is sad
Though once I was carefree, and a brave sailor lad
I courted a lassie, by night and by day
Ah, but now she has left me and sailed far away
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>
Oh, if I was a blackbird, could whistle and sing
I'd follow the vessel my true love sails in
An' in the top riggin, I would there build my nest
And I'd flutter my wings o'er her lily white breast
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
Or if was a scholar, and could handle the pen
One secret love letter my true love I'd send
I'd tell of my sorrow, my grief, and my pain
Since she's sailed over the ocean, to yon flowery glen
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
I sailed o'er the ocean, my fortune to seek
Though I'd miss her caress, and her kiss on my cheek
I sailed back to tell her my love was still warm
But she turned away lightly, and great was her scorn
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
I promised to take her to Donnybrooke faire
To buy her fine ribbons, to tie up her hair
I promised to marry, and to stay by her side
But she says in the mornin', she sails with the tide
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>
My parents, they chide me, an' will no' agree
Sayin' that me and my false love, married will never be
Ah, but let them deprive, oh let them do what they will
While there's breath in my body, she's the one that I love still
</lines>
