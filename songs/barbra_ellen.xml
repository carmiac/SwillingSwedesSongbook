    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
In scarlet town where I was born,
There was a fair maid dwellin';
Made ev'ry youth cry, Well-a-day!
And her name was Barb'ra Ellen,
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
Twas in the merry month of May,
When green buds they were swellin'.
Sweet William on this deathbed lay
For the love of Barb'ra Ellen
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
He sent a servant to the town,
To the place where she was dwellin'.
"My master's sick and he bids you come
If your name be Barb'ra Ellen.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
Then slowly, slowly she got up,
And slowly she went nigh him;
And as she drew the curtain back:
"Young man, I think you're dyin!"
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>
"O, ken you not in yonder town,
In the place where we were dwellin',
You gave a health to the ladies all,
But you slighted Barb'ra Ellen."
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>
"O, yes I ken. I ken it well.
In the place where we were dwellin',
I gave a health to the ladies all,
But my love to Barb'ra Ellen."
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v7">
      <lines>
Then slowly went she down the stairs.
He trembled like an aspen.
"Be kind, good friends and neighbors all,
Be kind to Barb'ra Ellen."
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v8">
      <lines>
And as she cross'd the wooded fields,
She heard his deathbell knellin',
And ev'ry stroke, it spoke her name
"Hard-hearted Barb'ra Ellen."
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v9">
      <lines>
She look'd to the east, she looked to the west.
She saw his corpse a comin'.
"O bearers, bearers, lay him down,
For I think I too am dying'."
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v10">
      <lines>
"O, Mother, Mother, make my bed,
And make it long and narrow.
Sweet William died for the love of me;
I'll die for him of sorrow!"
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v11">
      <lines>
"O, Father, Father, dig my grave,
And dig it deep and narrow.
Sweet William died for me today.
I'll die for him tomorrow."
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v12">
      <lines>
They buried her in the old churchyard.
They buried him beside her,
And from his heart grew a red, red rose,
And from her heart a briar.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v13">
      <lines>
They climb'd right up the old church wall
Till they couldn't climb no higher.
They tied themselves in a true lover's' knot,
The red rose around the briar.
</lines>
