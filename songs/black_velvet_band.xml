    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
In a neat little town they call Belfast,
An apprentice boy I was bound,
And many's the happy hour
I have spent in that neat little town.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
But bad misfortune o'er took me,
And caused me to stray from the land,
Far away from my friends and relations,
Betrayed by the black velvet band.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
Oh, one evening late as I rambled,
Not meaning to go very far,
When I met with a gay young deceiver.
She was plyin' her trade in a bar.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
Oh, her eyes they shone like the diamonds,
And I thought her the pride of the land,
And her hair hung over her shoulders,
Tied up with a black velvet band.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>
Oh, one evening a flashman, a watchman
She happened to meet on the sly.
I could tell that her mind it was altered,
By the roll of her roving dark eye.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>
Oh, that watch she took from his pocket.
She slipped it right into my hand.
Then she gave me in charge to the policeman.
Bad luck to the black velvet band.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v7">
      <lines>
Now before the Lord Mayor I was taken.
My guilt they proved quite plain,
And he said if I was not mistaken,
I should have to cross the salt main.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v8">
      <lines>
Now its sixteen long years have they gave me,
To plough upon Van Dieman's land,
Far away from my friends and relations,
A curse on the black velvet band.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v9">
      <lines>
So come all ye jolly young fellows,
I'll have ye take warning from me.
Whenever you're out on the liquor,
Beware of them pretty colleens.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v10">
      <lines>
They'll treat you to whiskey and porter,
Till you are not able to stand;
And the very next thing that you know, my lads,
You'll end up in Van Dieman's land.
</lines>
