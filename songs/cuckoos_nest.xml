    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
There's a fun place in the garden where the lads and lassies meet
For it wouldn't do to do the do they're doing in the street
And the first time I did come there I was very much impressed
By the young folk bust rufflin' up the cuckoos nest
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>
And it's hi the cuckoo ho the cuckoo hi the cuckoos nest
Hi the cuckoo ho the cuckoo hi the cuckoos nest
I'll give any man a shilling, and a bottle of the best
And ya ruffle up the feathers of the cuckoos nest
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
I met her in the morning, and I took her in the night
I'd never had another, so I had to do it right
I'd never gone a wingful and I never would have guessed
If she hadn't told me where to find the cuckoos nest
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
And she told me where to find it and she told me where to go
Through the prickles and the brambles where the little people go
And the minute that I found it she would never let me rest
'Till I ruffled up the feathers of the cuckoos nest
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
It was blarney it was prickled it was feathered all around
It was tucked into a corner and it wasn't easy found
She said &quot;God man you're buggering&quot; I said it wasn't true
And I left her with the makings of a young cuckoo
</lines>
