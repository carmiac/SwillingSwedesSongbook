    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
Out of the morning, in-to the night,
Thirty and three rode off to put the dread
Foe to flight led by the hand of Jenna
Thirty and three rode side by side,
And by the moonlight fortified.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
&quot;Fight on, my sisters,&quot; Jenna cried.
&quot;Fight for the Great White Alts.&quot;
The blood flowed swift, like good red wine,
As sisters took the battle line.
&quot;This kingdom I will claim for mine
And for the heart of Alta!&quot;
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
Thirty and three rode out that day
To hold the dreaded foe at bay,
But never more they passed this
Led by the hand of Jenna.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
Yet still, some say, in the darkest night
The sisters can be heard to fight
And you will see a flash of white,
The long white braid of Jenna.
</lines>
