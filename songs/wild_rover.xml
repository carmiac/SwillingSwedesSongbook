    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
I've been a wild rover for many a year,
And I've spent all my money on whiskey and beer,
But now I'm returning with gold in great store,
And I never will play the wild rover no more.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>
And it's no, nay, never. No, nay, never, no more, |
Will I play the rover. No never, no more. |
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
I went to an ale house I used to frequent,
And I told the landlady my money was spent.
I asked her for credit, she answered me nay.
Such custom like yours I could have any day.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
I took from my pocket ten sovereigns bright,
And the landlady's eyes opened wide with delight,
She said, &quot;I have whiskeys and wines of the best,
And I'll take you upstairs, and I'll show you the rest.&quot;
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
I'll go home to my parents, confess what I've done,
And I'll ask them to pardon their prodigal son.
And if they caress me as oft times before,
I never will play the wild rover no more!
