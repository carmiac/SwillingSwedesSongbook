    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>
All day long I'd sit upon my throne,
Watching all the peasants carry on. Ha.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
If I were a princess- La Da Da Da Da Da etc.
There would be a dozen virile knights
Fighting for my favor and my song.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
They'd come to court and give me all sorts of presents
Trinkets and lovely things to eat.
Then they'd bow and curtsey when I pass by.
They'd work so hard to please me hoping that I would
Tell them that their lives were now complete.
But I'd just keep them groveling at my feet. Ha!
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
But since I'm not a princess- La Da Da Da Da Da etc.
No one ever looks my way,
I'm the one who toils night and day
And I'll never hear the gentles say,
&quot;Oh, your highness have a lovely day.&quot;
