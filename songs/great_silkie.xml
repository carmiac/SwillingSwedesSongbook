    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
An earthly nurse sits and sings,
And aye, she sings by lily wean,
Sayin &quot;little ken I my bairn's father,
Far less the land where he dwells in.&quot;
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
For he came on night to her bed feet,
And a grumbly guest, I'm sure was he,
Saying &quot;Here am I, thy bairn's father,
Although I be not comely.&quot;
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
&quot;I am a man upon the land,
I am a silkie on the sea,
And when I'm far and far frae land,
My home it is in Sule Skerrie.&quot;
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
And he had ta'en a purse of gold
And he had placed it upon her knee,
Saying, &quot;Give to me my little young son,
And take thee up thy nurse's fee.&quot;
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>
&quot;And it shall come to pass on a summer's day,
When the sun shines bright on every stane,
I'll come and fetch my little young son,
And teach him how to swim the faem.&quot;
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>
&quot;And ye shall marry a gunner good,
And a right fine gunner I'm sure he'll be,
And the very first shot that e'er he shoots
Will kill both my young son and me.&quot;
</lines>
