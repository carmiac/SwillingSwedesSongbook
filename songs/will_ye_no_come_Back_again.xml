    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
Bonnie Charlie's now awa',
Safely owre the friendly main;
Mony a heart will break in twa,
Should he no' come back again.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>
Will ye no come back again?
Will ye no come back again?
Better lo'ed ye canna be,
Will ye no come back again?
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
Ye trusted in your Hieland men,
They trusted you, dear Charlie;
They kent you hiding in the glen.
Your cleadin' was but barely.
</lines>

    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
We watched you in the gloamin' hour,
We watched thee in the mornin' grey;
Tho' thirty thousand pounds they'd gie,
Oh, there was nane that wad betray.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
Mony a traitor 'mange the isles
Brak the band o' nature's laws;
Mony a traitor wi' his wiles,
Sought to wear his life awa'.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>
Many a gallant sodger gaught,
Mony a gallant chief did fa,
Death itself were dearly bought,
A' for Scotland's king and law.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>
Whene'er I hear the blackbird sing,
Unto the evening sinking down,
Or merl that makes the wood to ring,
To me they hae nae other sound.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v7">
      <lines>
Sweet the lav'rock's note and lang,
Lilting wildly up the glen;
And aye the o'er world o' he sang,
"Will he no' come back again?"
