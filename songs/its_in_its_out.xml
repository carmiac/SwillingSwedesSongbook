    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
Where is that hero I married?
Where is that lover that I knew?
Once we made merry love for hours, all night through.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
I don't remember growing older.
Somehow the years have slipped away.
Hormones are raging and I won't wait!
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>
It's up. It's down;
It's in. it's out.
Then it goes away.
Done is that fellow (phallus) that I played with,
Gone is the romping in the hay.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
Now he's older, growing older;
Still there is no way...
He claims the minutes now are hours,
timing was never his forte!
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
He's through, I'm not;
He's cold, I'm hot,
Sleep would come his way...
Finish the task my lord, I warn thee,
Or there'll be bloody hell to pay.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>
Gently he turns to me and whispers,
Words that do set my soul aflame;
Then with a loving smile he takes me,
Things have changed!
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>
Evening is turning into daylight
Some things will never be the same.
Now I am begging him for mercy,
I've been tamed
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c2">
      <lines>
No doubt, it's up.
It's in, its out,
And it seems to stay.
Now it's this lady who needs sleep, dear,
Later we'll love again and play.
</lines>
