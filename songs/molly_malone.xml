    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
In Dublin's fair city where girls are so pretty
'Twas there that I first met sweet Molly Malone
As she wheeled her wheelbarrow
Through street broad and narrow
Crying, &quot;Cockles and mussels, alive, alive oh&quot;
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>
Alive, alive oh, alive, alive oh,
Crying, &quot;Cockles and mussels, alive, alive oh&quot;
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
Now she was a fishmonger and sure 'twas no wonder
For so were her mother and father before
And they each wheeled their barrows
Through streets broad and narrow
Crying, &quot;Cockles and mussels, alive, alive oh&quot;
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
She died of a fever and no one could save her
And that was the end of sweet Molly Malone
Now her ghost wheels her barrow
Through streets broad and narrow
Crying, &quot;Cockles and mussels, alive, alive oh&quot;
</lines>
