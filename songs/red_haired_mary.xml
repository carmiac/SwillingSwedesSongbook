    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
As I was going to the Faire of Dingle,
One fine morning last July,
And walking down the road before me,
A red-haired girl I chanced to spy.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
Come ride with me, my red-hair maiden,
My donkey, he can carry two.
She looked at me, her eyes a-twinklin'
And her cheeks a rosy hue.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>
Keep your hands off Red Haired Mary,
Her and I will soon be wed.
We'll see a priest this very morning,
Tonight we'll lie in a marriage bed.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
Now when we reached the town of Dingle,
I took her hand to say goodbye.
When a tinker, he stepped up beside me,
And belted me in my left eye.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
Well I was feelin' kinda peevish,
My poor old eye felt sad and sore,
When I tapped him gently with my hobnails
And he flew back to Murphy's door.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>
Well he galloped off to find his brothers,
The tallest men I e'er did meet,
When he tapped me gently with his knuckles,
And I was minus two front teeth.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>
Now a pealer, he came round the corner,
Said, "Young man, you done broke the law."
When my donkey kicked him in the kneecaps
And he fell down and broke his jaw.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v7">
      <lines>
Well the red hair girl, she kept a'smiling,
"Young man, I'll come with you," she said.
We'll forget the priest this very morning,
Tonight we'll lie in Murphy's shed.
</lines>
