    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
A lusty young smith at his vice stood a'filing
His hammer lay by but his forge still aglow
When to him a buxom young damsel came smiling
And asked him to work at her forge he would go
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>
With a jingle bang jingle bang jingle bang jingle
With a jingle bang jingle bang jingle hi-ho
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
I will said the smith, and they went off together
Along to the young damsels forge they did go
They stripped to go to it, 'twas hot work and hot weather
She kindled a fire, and she soon made him glow
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
Her husband, she said, no good work could afford her
His strength and his tool were worn out long ago
The smith said, well mine are in very good order
And now I am ready my skill for to show
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
Red hot grew his iron as both did desire
But he was too wise not to strike while 'twas so
Said she, What I get I get out of the fire,
So with it strike home and redouble the blow
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>
Six times did his iron through vigorous heating
Grow soft in the forge in a minute or so
And often would harden still beating and beating
But the more it did soften did harden more slow
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>
At last went the smith, 'towards the dame full of sorrow
Oh what I would give could my husband do so
Good lad with your hammer come hither tomorrow
But pray could you use it once more 'ere you go?
</lines>
