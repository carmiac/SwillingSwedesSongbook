      <lines>
A German clockwinder to Dublin once came
Benjamin Fuchs was the old German's name
And as he was winding his way 'round the strand
He played on his flute and the music was grand
</lines>

Too-ra-lam-a-lam-a, Too-ra-lam-a-lam-a Too-ra-li-ay
Too-ra-li Oo-ra-li Oo-ra-li-ay
Too-ra-lam-a-lam-a, Too-ra-lam-a-lam-a Too-ra-li-ay
Too-ra-li Oo-ra-li Oo-ra-li-ay

There was a young lady from Grovenor Square
Who said that her clock was in need of repair
In walked the German and to her delight
In less than five minutes, he had her clock right
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
And as they were sitting right down on the floor
There came a very loud knock on the door
In walked her husband and great was his shock
To see the old German wind up his wife's clock
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
Then says her husband, &quot;Look here Mary Ann,
Don't let that old German come in here again.
He wound up your clock and left mine on the shelf.
If your old clock needs winding I'll do it myself!&quot;
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>
Then says the German, &quot;Sure I meant you no harm,
But the spring wouldn't work in your old wife's alarm.
I pulled out me oil can and I gave it a squirt;
If you keep it well-oiled, your wife's clock will work!&quot;
