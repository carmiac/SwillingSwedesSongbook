    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
An echo asunder, a fast rising yell,
A call through the ranks for the fighters from hell.
Golias has risen and echoed the call,
With footsteps of thunder, a blue painted wall!

    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>
Here's one for our College here, one for our King!
Here's one for the Outlands, and for our Queen!
We raise up the standard, sound out the cry,
It goes up together, echoes on high, it echoes on high.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
We fight with the goblets and sword on our shield,
We fight with the spear and the glaive that won't yield.
We form with a line that will stand to the end,
We fight every battle down to the last man!

    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
Our rapiers, they flash in the noon-day sun,
Through the field of battle, the cry to Lay On!
We labor and sweat through the dust of the keep,
Our bodies they're struck, in a pile so deep!
