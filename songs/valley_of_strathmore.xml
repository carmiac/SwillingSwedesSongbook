    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
By the clear and winding streams
Of the valley of Strathmore
Where my love and I have been
Where we wander nevermore
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>
But if time were a thing man could buy
All the money that I have in store
I would give for one day by her side
In the Valley of Strathmore
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
From the glen of the golden an' green
I have left for a land far away
Where sadness has ne'er been seen
And joy only costs a day's pay
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
In Strathmore theres a long workin' day
For the man who lays hands on the hill
But it's work I'd be happy to do
If at night I was lyin' with you
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
As I take a long draught from my glass
I am drinkin' the Long Hill again
But I try no to think on my loss
For the old days will ne'er come again
</lines>
    </verse>
