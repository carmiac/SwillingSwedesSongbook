    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
Oh my name is McShane from the plains of Kildare
Farmer I was, until the last year
Till I got a notion out by the promotion
Went over to England to harvest my share
</lines>

Rum turalee, rum tur-a-lalley
Rum turalee, misha tur-a-lie-ay

    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
I parted with Molly so blithe and so jolly
I picked up a stick for a staff in me hand
To keep myself cheery, for fear I'll grow weary
I sang as I walked as I marched through the land
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
I landed in England on a bright summers evening
The lap of the kiltar I held in me hand
Some of them laughing, and some of them chanting
And some of them trying to put Paddy away
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
I went to this woman, and I asked her for lodging
She instantly showed me the bed in the room
And being so tired and so worn out from walking
I layed myself down on the bed in the room
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>
Old Lumpar the Tinker stood up from the corner
He said &quot;By my soul I will cut off your life&quot;
Says I &quot;Old Tinker, you know who you're daggin'
For I'm old McShane from the plains of Kildare&quot;
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>
He tried for to fetch me a punch in the stomach
I instantly nailed him a one in the throat
He went like a heel over head in the corner
and cut his old head on a rusty old cot
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v7">
      <lines>
He lay on the floor, like a sheep he was bleeding
I swore by my soul I would cut off his life
I lifted him up and sat down for a naggin'
and me and old Tinker we ended our strife
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v8">
      <lines>
Well my name is McShane from the plains of Kildare
Farmer I was until the last year
Till I got a notion out by the promotion
Went over to England to harvest my share
