    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
My lady love please come to me,
The Newbie Drinkers have gone to sleep
Though they were loud they have gone away
And now we no longer must hear them
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>
Newbie Drinkers you cannot see
Newbie Drinker don't puke on me
The bottle is dry this cannot be
For now we must open another
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
We went to bed for our lawful rest
But now we face an awful test
The Newbie Drinkers are retching loud,
We may not be able to sleep
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
Poor Lorie dear it was her first time
To mix the Vodka and Scotch so fine
To her the Vodka it had no taste
But the Scotch it did make her to heave
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
And Doug dear Doug the Experienced man
Who could not drink with just one hand
He stumbled back, and he stumbled forth
Until he could no longer walk
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>
Bob, dear Mom, and Loreena too
Could not turn backs to these Newbie few
Yes they would come to the rescue
Of these Newbie Drinkers
</lines>
