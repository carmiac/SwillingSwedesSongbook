      <lines>
Come through the heather, around and gather
You are the welcomer early
Come round the flame, we are your kin
For wha'll be King but Charlie
Come through the heather, around and gather
You are the welcomer early
To crown your Rightful, Lawful King
For wha'll be King but Charlie
</lines>

Will soothe your mind, but fairly
For ships o' war hae just come in
and landed Royal Charlie
</lines>

Fae Johnny great stay early
They to a man declare to stand
Or fall wi' Royal Charlie

Wi' money ya' love and wealth
They declared for Scotlands King and Law
And spear ya wha' fer Charlie

His very name would warm the heart
To arms for Royal Charlie
