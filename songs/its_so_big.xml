    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
A cup, a cup,
My kingdom for a cup.
Two lords a goin' to the field.
Without protection had to yield.
Lord Taran offered his cup;
The first lord picked it up.
He went away to try it on,
To his dismay the size was wrong.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>
It's so big;
It's so incredibly big.
Can't believe my eyes,
A magnificent size!
I'll never fill it up;
And neither will my friend;
Or the two of us...together!
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
A cup, a cup,
My kingdom for a cup.
The feast was ready to be served;
Without the bowl that it deserved.
Lord Taran offered his cup;
A lady picked it up.
A ladle full she did put in,
And then the floor did meet her chin.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c2">
      <lines>
It's so big;
It's so incredibly big.
Can't believe my eyes,
A magnificent size!
I'll never fill it up.
There's not enough soup at the feast,
Or the village!
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
A cup, a cup,
My kingdom for a cup.
A toast the King did wish to make.
Without a goblet hard to fake.
Lord Taran offered his cup;
The King he picked it up.
Discreetly poured his drink inside,
And then looked like he nearly died.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c3">
      <lines>
It's so big,
It's so incredibly big.
Can't believe my eyes,
A magnificent size!
I'll never fill it up.
Whatta' you think I am?
I only brought one bottle!
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
A cup, a cup,
My kingdom for a cup.
Lord Taran was all suited up.
The one thing missing was his cup.
A page he found the cup;
Lord Taran picked it up.
He went inside to put it on;
And every lady's eye was drawn.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c4">
      <lines>
It's so big,
It's so incredibly big.
Can't believe my eyes,
A magnificent size!
I hope he fills it up;
He better fill it up...
He's got a legend to live up to now.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c5">
      <lines>
It's so big;
It's so incredibly big.
Can't believe my eyes,
A magnificent size!
I hope he fills it up.
I hope...he fills...it up.
