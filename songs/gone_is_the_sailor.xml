    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
Home is the sailor, home from the docks
Bringing home the groceries, and the smell of tar
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
Why does the sailor smell of tar, he doesn't drink the bloody stuff?
Life is full of mysteries, and this is one
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
The sailor is a worried man like everybody else
Bringing in the washing, and the smell of tar
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
When does the sailor sail his boat, we never see him doing it?
Life is full of mysteries, and this is two
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>
Gone is the sailor, gone to the pub
Ordering a bag of crisps, and a tot of rum
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>
Why does the sailor order a bag of crisps, his shaky fingers cannot tear it open
I've sung about the sailor, and now I'm done
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v7">
      <lines>
Except to sing
Why does the sailor smell of tar, he doesn't drink the bloody stuff....
</lines>
    </verse>
