    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
In early May, when skies are gay
And green the plains and mountains,
At break of day I rose to play
Beside a little fountain.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
In garden close where shone the rose
I heard a fiddle played, then
A handsome knight that charmed my sight,
Was dancing with a maiden.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
Both fair of face, they turned with grace
To tread their May-time measure.
The flowering place, their close embrace:
Their kisses brought them pleasure.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
But shortly they had slipped away
To stroll among the bowers.
To ease their heart, each played his part
In love's games on the flowers.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>
I crept ahead, all chill with dread,
Lest someone there should see me.
Bemused and sad because I had
No joy in love to please me.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>
Then one of those I'd seen their rose
And from afar off speaking,
He questioned me, who I might be,
And what I came there seeking.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v7">
      <lines>
I stepped their way to sadly say
How long I'd loved a lady,
Who all my days my heart obeys,
Full faithfully and steady.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v8">
      <lines>
Though still I bore a grief so sore
In losing one so lovely,
That surely I would come to die
Unless she deigned to love me.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v9">
      <lines>
With wisdom rare, with tactful air
They counselled and relieved me.
They said their prayer was God might spare
Some joy in love that grieved me.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v10">
      <lines>
Where all my gain was loss and pain
So I in turn extended
My thanks sincere, with many a tear,
And them to God commended.
</lines>
