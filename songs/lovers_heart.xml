    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
She was in the flowery garden, when first she caught my eye
And I just a marching soldier; she smiled as I passed by
The flowers she held were fresh an' fair, her lips were full and red
And as I passed that shady bower, she turned to me and said
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>
Last night we spoke of love
Now we're forced to part
You leave to the sound of a marching drum
And the beat of a lover's heart
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
She was by the shore in the evening, when next I saw my dear
Running barefoot by the waterside, she called as I drew near
The sunlight glanced at the waters edge, makin' fire of her auburn hair
My young heart danced at her parting words that hung in the evening air
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
She was on the Strand next morning when orders came to sail
And as we slipped our ropes away I watched her from the rail
She threw me a rose which fell between us, and floated in the bay
And as our ship pulled from the shore, I heard her call and say
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
Now the soldiers life won't suit me, sweet music is my trade
For I'd rather melt the heardest heart, than pierce it with a blade
Let the time be short 'til I return to my home in the north of Skye
And the loving girl who stole my heart, with these words as I passed by
</lines>
    </verse>
