    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
You may talk about your lancers, or your Irish Fusiliers,
The Aberdeen Militia or the Queen's Own Volunteers;
Or any other regiment that's lying far awa'
Come gie to me the tartan of the gallant Forty Twa.

      <lines>
And strolling through the green fields on a summer day
Watching all the country girls working at the hay,
I really was delighted and he stole my heart awa'
When I saw him in the tartan of the gallant Forty Twa.

    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
Oh I never will forget the day his regiment marched past
The pipes they played a lively tune but my heart was aghast,
He turned around and smiled farewell and then from far awa'
He waved at me the tartan of the gallant Forty Twa.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
Once again I heard the music of the pipers from afar
They tramped and tramped, the weary men returning from the war
And as they nearer drew I brushed a woeful tear awa'
For me and my braw laddie of the gallant Forty Twa.
