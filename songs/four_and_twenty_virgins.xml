      <lines>
Four and twenty virgins came down from Inverness
And when they went back home again they were four and twenty less
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>
Singin' balls to your partner
Ass against the wall
If ya canna' get laid on a Saturday night (In the SCA, At [Name of Event], etc.)
Ya canna' get laid at all
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
The village idiot he was there, now what do you think of that?
Amusin' himself while abusin' himself, and catchin' it in his hat
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
The village whore now she was there, a layin' on the floor
And every time she opened her legs the suction closed the door
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
The village vicar now he was there, a-gettin' drunk and loud
He was swingin' from the ceiling while pissin' on the crowd
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>
The village baker he was there, so drunk he began to scream
He grabbed the girls like great big tarts and pumped them full of cream
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>
The village potter he was there, he made a dong of clay
He sat the girls upon the wheel and gave them all a lay
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v7">
      <lines>
The village rabbi he was there, treatin' a knife like a toy
He swung and swished and he took an inch off every man and boy
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v8">
      <lines>
The village acrobat he was there, a' screwin' on the stair
The bannister broke, he doubled his stroke and finished her off in midair
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v9">
      <lines>
The village postman he was there, the poor man had the pox
He couldn't get a piece inside, so he screwed his own mailbox
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v10">
      <lines>
The village hunter he was there, polishin' his gun with skill
Four girls were all barin' their asses, waitin' for the kill
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v11">
      <lines>
The village fool now he was there, he had an amazin' lack of wits
For every time a girl would pass, he'd just drool on her tits
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v12">
      <lines>
The village virgin she was there, the poor girl got a scare
But from under her dress she heard a voice &quot;It's only my tongue up there!&quot;
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v13">
      <lines>
The village swordsman he was there, he had a rod like a train
And when he rammed an ass they cried, &quot;My god he impaled my brain&quot;
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v14">
      <lines>
The village constable he was there, a-twirlin' his billy stick
Surprised were all the girls to find it was really a twelve inch prick
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v15">
      <lines>
The village maiden now she was there, a clingin' to her dress
Bein' chased by a hoard of horny priests, her sins they would confess
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v16">
      <lines>
The village nun she was there, great stains upon her habit
That was because she spent the night screwin' like a rabbit
</lines>
