<comment>Repeat the second and fourth lines for each verse</comment>
I left home when I was fifteen
Oh mother now pray for me
Me and Old Tom took to the sea
On the good ship Pelican's Wing
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
The days were long but the nights were warm
And we sailed through the winds of the summer storms
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
First we made for the shores of France
With a load of silk and a girl who danced
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
Then we made for the English land
We were there three days, then we sailed again
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>
She was a swift-sailed trader with a merry crew
I liked each man and the captain too
And when the work was done we would laugh and sing
On the good ship Pelican's Wing
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>
We were six days out of Bristol town
When Davy spied a sail that was bearing down
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>
The captain said &quot;Oh lads, I fear
We've come across the flag of a privateer.&quot;
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v7">
      <lines>
So we raised our mains and we made to run
We were a peace-time trader and we had few guns
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v8">
      <lines>
But though we flew over the ocean wave
The other ship caught us in just one day
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v9">
      <lines>
They came at us with dawn's first light
And we readied ourselves and we made to fight
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v10">
      <lines>
Old Tom died with steel in his hand
And my other friends followed, nigh to the man
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v11">
      <lines>
But they left me here upon this rock
With a piece of bread wrapped in old sailcloth
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v12">
      <lines>
But they left me no water for the heat of the day
And I could hear them laughing as they sailed away
</lines>
    </verse>
