    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
'Twas on a dark and starry night
The King did come to me
Saying &quot;Quickly gird you for the fight
And its off to war we'll be&quot;
So I'm gathering my men at arms
Good shieldmen one and all
And it's off to fight in Western lands
Where allied brethren fall
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>
My Kingdom is The Outlands
And of Her I will sing
My lady has my truest love
My blood is for my King
I'm following His Majesty
In some hot foreign war
My heart is in The Outlands, and it will be ever more
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
Eight hundred mile we rode our steeds
To meet them in the sun
Some God-forsaken enemy
Stout warriors every one
Our allied brothers at our sides
Good men from Calontir
The Aten King cried &quot;Forward men&quot;
To death on Outlands spears
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
We met them on the broken field
Their blood in rivers ran
Their King refused the right to yield
We killed them to a man
We hit the Aten shield wall
They dropped their swords and fled
When The Outlands had won through it all
You could not count the dead
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
At Pennsic AS Twenty-three
The Outlands on the field
The Eastern flanking shield wall
Never had the chance to yield
We drove them back like cattle
As they fell beneath our swords-
King Christopher, Queen Cymber
And Their Noble Outlands Lords
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>
We stood in Adlersruhe
A bridge covered in gore
Outnumbered in a foreign land
Held to the Oaths we swore
The plains were dark with Lions
Black Stars of Ansteorre
The White Stag leapt to battle
Now the Lion leaps no more
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>
Our ladies met them at the pass
Sixteen fighters strong
The Aten men laughed at them
Queen Tara proved them wrong
They struck the Aten shield wall
And men heard a death bell ring
Now no longer will they scoff
For they felt the beauties sting
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v7">
      <lines>
Our king called us to battle
To fight the Aten horde
They've never lost Estrella men
Our allies need this war
We swept them on the open field
We crushed them in the fray
The Aten Army's spirit broke
The Outlands won the day
</lines>
