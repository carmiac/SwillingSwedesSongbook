    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
First you take a crazy mon
bits of metal he strap on
in one hand a nasty sword
in the other ironing board.
He learn de moves, he learn de walk
He den become the fightin' jock
All around de eric walk
as we watch de fightin' jock
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
He go to practice every day
see other jocks all like to play
Dey hit him on his crazy head
a million times he fallin' dead
Dey hit him many many time
He tinks dis not so very fine
De ladies all begin to talk
and now dey all laugh at limpin' jock
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>
Hit him harder, man!
Oh, be a good tin can!
How low was that blow?
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
Den he limp onto de field
he get knocked down, he have to yield
Den he limp back to his tent
his sword is broke, his helm is bent
He limp so hard, he limp so quick
but he get hit with nasty stick
all around de eric walk
as we watch de limpin' jock
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
Den one day the sun come up
and de stick jock get fed up
He go down to de merchant row
He trade his armor for a bow
He tired of bruises on his pelt
Don't win no crown, don't get no belt
So now around the field he walks
he laughin' hard and shootin' jocks
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>
And now the moral of dis song
you can only fight so long
before your brains fall out your ears
and dey turn you into peers
If you don't fight, den you can play
and meet new ladies every day
and den around the eric walk
as you be laughin' at de jocks.
