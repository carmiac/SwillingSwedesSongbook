    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
There were twelve sisters by a lake,
Rosemary, bayberry, thistle and thorn,
A handsome sailor one did take,
And that day a child was born.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
A handsome sailor one did wed,
Rosemary, bayberry, thistle and thorn,
The other sisters wished her dead
On the day the child was born.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
"Oh, sister, give me your right hand,"
Rosemary, bayberry, thistle and thorn,
Eleven to the one demand
On the day the child was born.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
They laid her down upon the hill,
Rosemary, bayberry, thistle and thorn,
And took her babe against her will
On the day the child was born.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>
They left her on the cold hillside,
Rosemary, bayberry, thistle and thorn,
Convinced that her new babe had died
On the day the child was born.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>
She wept red tears, and she wept gray,
Rosemary, bayberry, thistle and thorn,
Till she had wept her life away,
On the day her child was born.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v7">
      <lines>
The sailor's heart it broke in two,
Rosemary, bayberry, thistle and thorn,
The sisters all their act did rue
From the day the child was born.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v8">
      <lines>
And from their graves grew rose and briar,
Rosemary, bayberry, thistle and thorn,
Twined till they could grow no higher,
From the day the child was born.
</lines>
