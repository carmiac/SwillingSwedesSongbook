    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
Have ye heard the story from the land of Calontir?
With sword and axe a-swinging fit to make a grown man fear?
The barons called for taxes, the people answered &quot;Nay!&quot;
&quot;And if you come collecting, there'll be hell to pay!

    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>
Have you seen the army, it was here a while ago,
And do you know who's winning? Have we struck a mortal blow?
I do not know your armor, but you seem a friend to me,
Oh have you seen the army marching in Forgotten Sea?
HMMMMMMMMMMM

    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
You should have seen the battle, 'twas a glory to be seen,
Conveniently the dead were rolled into a deep ravine,
The bandits followed Halidar into a brushy patch,
If it hadn't been poison ivy they'd have won without a scratch!
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
'Twas at the bridge they tell me, that they made their final stand,
But it's hard to win a battle when you're killed by your own man.
The captain of the guardsmen hit upon a plan so bold,
With a trick used every tax-time, hide your sacks of gold!
