    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
Oh, farewell, lovely Nancy, for now I must leave you
To the south bonny seas I am bound for to go
And though we are parted, my love be true hearted
For I will return in the spring as you know
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
And she says, like a sea boy, I will dress and go with you
In the midst of all your dangers, your friend I'll remain
And in the cold stormy weather, when the winds they are a' blowin'
I'll always be ready for to beef your top sail
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
Oh you delicate fingers, they can't handle our tackle
Your delicate feet to our top mast cannot go
And your lovely behind love, it would freeze in the whiling gale
I'd have you on shore when the winds they do blow
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
So farewell lovely Nancy, for now I must leave you
To the south bonny seas my course I do steer
But though we are parted, my love be true hearted
For I will return in the spring of the year
</lines>
