    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
I know my love by his way of walkin',
And I know my love by his way of talkin',
And I know my love dressed in a suit of blue,
And if my love leaves me, what shall I do?
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>
And still she cried, &quot;I love him the best,
And a troubled mind sure can know no rest.&quot;
And still she cried, &quot;Bonny boys are few,
And if my love leaves me, what shall I do?&quot;
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
There is a dance house in Maradyke
And there my true love goes every night.
He takes a strange one upon his knee
And don't you think now that vexes me!
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
If my love knew I could wash and wring,
If my love knew I could weave and spin,
I'd make a coat all of the finest kind,
But the want of money leaves me behind.
</lines>
