    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
They sailed away on that gallant barque
Roy Niell and his fair young bride
They had ventured all on that bounding ship
That danced on the silvery tide
And his heart was young, and his spirit light
As he kissed her tears away
And they watched the shore retreat from sight
Of their own sweet Dublin Bay
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
Three days they sailed when the storm arose
And the lightnin' swept the beam
When the thunder crash broke the sharp repose
Of the wee three sailors sleep
Roy Niell he clasped his weepin' bride
And he kissed the tears away
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
&quot;Oh aloft was a fear for lower&quot; he cried
&quot;When we left sweet Dublin Bay&quot;
On the crowded deck of that doomed ship
Some fairlander did despair
And some o'er come wi' a whole yuir hearts
Of the God of the storm an' prayer
&quot;She has struck a rock&quot; the sailors cried
An' their breath of wild dismay
And that ship went down wi' the fair young bride
That sailed from Dublin Bay
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
They sailed away in that gallant barque
Roy Niell and his fair young bride
They had ventured all on that bounding ship
That danced on the silvery tide
But his heart was young, and his spirit light
As he kissed her tears away
And they watched the shore retreat from sight
Of their own sweet Dublin Bay
