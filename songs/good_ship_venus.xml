    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
We sailed upon the good ship Venus
By Christ you should have seen us
The figurehead was a whore in bed
The mast an upright penis
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
The Captain's name was Lugger
By Christ he was a bugger
He wasn't fit to shovel shit
From one ship to another
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>
<comment>Chorus every two verses</comment>
Friggin' in the riggin'
Friggin' in the riggin'
Friggin' in the riggin'
There was fuck all else to do
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
The first mate's name was Cooper
By Christ, he was a trooper
He jerked and jerked until he worked
Himself into a stupor
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
And the second mate was Andy
By Christ he had a dandy
Till they crushed his cock on a jagged rock
For cumming in the brandy
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>
The third mate's name was Morgan
By God he was a gorgon
Ten times a day sweet tunes he'd play
On his fuckin' organ
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>
Captain's wife was Mabel
And by God was she able
To give the crew their daily screw
Upon the galley table
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v7">
      <lines>
The captain's daughter Charlotte
Was born and bred a harlot
Her thighs at night were lily white
By morning they were scarlet
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v8">
      <lines>
The cabin boy was Kipper
By Christ he was a nipper
He stuffed his ass with broken glass
And circumcised the skipper
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v9">
      <lines>
The captain's lovely daughter
Liked swimming in the water
Delighted squeals came when some eels
Found her sexual quarters
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v10">
      <lines>
When we reached our station
Through skillful navigation
The ship got sunk in a wave of spunk
From too much fornication
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v11">
      <lines>
On the good ship Venus
By Christ you should have seen us
The figurehead was a whore in bed
Sucking a dead man's penis
</lines>
