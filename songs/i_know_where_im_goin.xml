    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
I know where I'm goin',
And I know who's a goin' with me,
I know who I love
But the dear knows who I'll marry!
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
I have stockings of silk,
Shoes of fine green leather,
Combs to buckle my hair,
And a ring for every finger.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
Some say he's black,
But I say he's bonny,
The fairest of them all
My handsome, winsome Johnny.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
Feather beds are soft,
And painted rooms are bonny,
But I would leave them all
To go with my love Johnny.
</lines>
