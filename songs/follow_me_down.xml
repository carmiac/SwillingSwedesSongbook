    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
Oh then follow me down where the milk water flows,
And I'll show you the dew like the tears of rose,
And so like a rose my petals fell down,
And I left my self open to the thorns and the frowns,
To the thorns and the frowns.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
For when I was a maiden he lay long with me,
And the fruit of his loving soon all eyes could see,
And the growing within and the love waiting there,
To feel the warm sun and to breath the sweet air,
And to breath the sweet air.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
And when sunset arrived full of hope, full of fear,
To give birth through my pain, through my joy and my fears,
At my breast then he lay, a child of the sun.
Oh many were the whispers, "Oh, what has she done?"
"Oh what has she done?"
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
For my love he had gone to fight that ancient war,
And I felt a deep sorrow I had not felt before,
When the news of his dying came to my birth bed,
One love lay breathing while the other lay dead,
While the other lay dead.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>
And often I wonder as I sit all alone,
Why a curse upon those a new life have grown,
Why they cause life to end with their lies and their greed,
Shamelessly proud of their unholy creed,
Of their unholy creed.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>
Oh then follow me down where the mild water flows,
And I'll show you the dew like the tears of a rose,
And so like a rose so fragrant and strong,
Children will carry dreams into the dawn,
Into the new dawn.
</lines>
