    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
Kind friends and companions, come join me in rhyme
Come lift up your voices in chorus with mine
Let's drink and be merry, all grief to refrain
For we may or might never all meet here again
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>
Here's a health to the company and one to my lass
Let's drink and be merry all out of one glass
Let's drink and be merry, all grief to refrain
For we may or might never all meet here again
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
Here's a health to the wee lass that I love so well
For kindness and beauty there's none can excel
She smiles on my countenance as she sits on my knee
There's no one on this wide world as happy as me
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
Our ship lies at anchor, she is ready to dock
I wish her safe landing without any shock
And if ever we should meet again, by land or by sea
I will always remember your kindness to me
</lines>
