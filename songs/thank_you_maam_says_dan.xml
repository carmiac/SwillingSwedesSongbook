&quot;What brought you into my room, to my room, to my room,
What brought you into my room?&quot; said the mistress unto Dan.
&quot;I came to court your daughter, Ma'am I thought it no great harm, Ma'am!&quot;
&quot;Oh Dan me dear, you're welcome here!&quot;
&quot;Thank you ma'am,&quot; says Dan.

&quot;How came you to know my daughter, my daughter, my daughter,
How came you to know my daughter?&quot; says the mistress unto Dan.
&quot;Going to the well for water, Ma'am, to raise the can I taught her, Ma'am!&quot;
&quot;Oh Dan, 'tis you're the handy man!&quot;
&quot;Thank you, Ma'am,&quot; says Dan.

&quot;Oh, you can have my daughter, my daughter, my daughter,
Yes you can have my daughter,&quot; says the mistress unto Dan,
&quot;But when you take my daughter, Dan, of course you'll take me also, Dan!
Oh, Dan me dear, you're welcome here!&quot;
&quot;Thank you, Ma'am,&quot; says Dan.

This couple they got married, got married, got married,
This couple they got married, Miss Elizabeth and Dan;
And now he keeps her mother and her father, and her brother and Dan.
&quot;Oh, Dan, 'tis you're the lucky man!&quot;
&quot;Thank you, Ma'am,&quot; says Dan.
