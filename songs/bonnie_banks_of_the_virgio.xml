    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
Three sisters walked out one fine day,
All the lee and the lonely-o,
Met a robber on the way,
On the bonnie, bonnie banks of the Virgio.
<comment>Repeat &quot;All the lee...&quot; and &quot;On the bonnie...&quot; in each verse</comment>

    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
He took the first one by the hand,
All the lee and the lonely-o,
He whipped her 'round and he made her stand,
On the bonnie, bonnie banks of the Virgio.
