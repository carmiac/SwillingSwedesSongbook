    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
Well, come sit ye down, and I'll tell you a tale
It concerns what goes on 'tween lads and lasses
'Tis a good thing to learn for any canny lass
And when I am done you will thank me.

    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>
Red is yer nose as on yer face it grows
And red is me face as I sit here
And red is the hand does the spankin' in this land
But my arse is redder than any!
</lines>

    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
&quot;Now come to the bed, me bonnie little wife,
And we'll have a bit of slap-and-tickle.
And willing I went and well was I served
But 'twas then that I made my great blunder.

    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
&quot;Oh, Johnnie, my love, your lovin' has no peer&quot;
And truer words were never spoken
But Robbie's the name of my duly wedded lord
And John is the name of my lover.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
Then up from the bed, me husband bolted up
And great was his rage as he shouted,
&quot;Now how is it, wife that ye call another's name,
When I should be all that ye think of?&quot;
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>
My tale now is done, as I shift from cheek to cheek
The lesson I learned is quite simple;
If ye canna hold your tongue when ye're lyin' with a man,
'Tis best ye remain ever faithful!
