    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
Ma'am dear, did ye never hear of pretty Molly Brannigan?
In troth, then, she's left me and I'll never be a man again.
Not a spot on my hide will a summer's sun e'er tan again
Since Molly's gone and left me here alone for to die.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
The place where my heart was you'd aisy rowl a turnip in,
'Tis large as all Dublin, and from Dublin to the Divil's glen:
If she'd wish'd to take another, sure she might have left mine back again
And not have gone and left me here alone for to die.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
Ma'am dear, I remember when the milking time was past and gone
We strolled thro' the meadow, and she swore I was the only one
That ever she could love, but oh! the base and cruel one,
For all I that she's left me here alone for to die.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
Ma'am dear, I remember when coming home the rain began,
I wrapt my frieze-coat round her and ne'er a waistcoat had I on
And my shirt was rather fine-drawn, but oh! the false and cruel one,
For all that she's left me here alone for to die.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>
The left side of my carcase is as weak as water gruel, ma'am,
There's not a pick upon my bones, since Molly's proved so cruel ma'am
Oh! if I had a blunder gun, I'd go and fight a duel, ma'am,
For sure I'd better shoot myself than live here to die.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>
I'm cool an' determined as any salamander, ma'am,
Won't you come to my wake when I go the long meander, ma'am?
I'll think myself as valiant as the famous Alexander, ma'am
When I hear ye cryin' o'er me, &quot;Arrah! why did ye die?&quot;
