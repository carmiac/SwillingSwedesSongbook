    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
I once had a sword
Or should I say, it once had me
I just picked it up
Oh what a sword
It was plus three
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
Its ego was twelve
A fact of which I wasn't aware
I tried to leave
And I found that the sword didn't care
Oh, oh, oh
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
I walked through the halls
Wasting my time
Nothing to find
Then I turned around
And then I said
&quot;Oh no, undead&quot;
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
The thirty two knights saw me coming
And started to laugh
I closed my eyes
As my sword started hewing a path
Oh, oh, oh
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>
And when I awoke
I was alone
That sword had flown
Now I use a club
Isn't it good
No-Ego wood
</lines>
    </verse>
