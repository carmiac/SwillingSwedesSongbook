On the twelfth round of the tourney,
My true love said to me,
Is Commondopolous the best you can do?î
I can't stand the pressure!î
We'll banish him at Twelfth Night.î
Princess would've been nicer.î
My membership's in question.î
Merchant's Row's still open!î
What's a Guildmarion?î
It's only a scratch!î
I missed your forth round fight.î
Don't mess up the favor!î
I want a Tudor Step-up!î
and...
I... Want to be Queen!î

On the ride homeward,
My true love said to me,
We'll get ëem at the March Crown!î
