    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
As I went out one may morning,
One may morning betime,
I met a maid, from home had strayed,
Just as the sun did shine.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
&quot;What makes you rise so soon, my dear,
Your journey to pursue?
Your pretty little feet, they tread so neat.
Strike off the morning dew.&quot;
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
&quot;I'm going to feed my father's flock,
His young and tender lambs,
That over hills and over dales
Lie waiting for their dams.&quot;
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
&quot;Oh stay, oh stay, you handsome maid,
And rest a moment here,
For there is none but you alone
That I do love so dear.&quot;
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>
&quot;How gloriously the sun doth shine,
How pleasant 'tis the air.
I'd rather rest on a true love's breast
Than any other where.&quot;
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>
&quot;For I am thine and thou art mine.
No man shall uncomfort thee.
We'll join our hands in wedded bands
And a-married we will be.&quot;
</lines>
