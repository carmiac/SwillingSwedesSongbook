    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
I was born in battle's fire
Laid beside my mother's corpse
My toys the ravens of the field
My lullabies the screams of horse
But when that storm god you all praise
Walks the earth and shatters trees
You huddle close beside my gift
And whisper prayers beside the spit
And as the woodsmoke turns and twists
You owe your lives to sly Loki.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
Odin saw me on the field
And recognized his bastard son
There he claimed me for his own
Heir to all that he had won
But when that storm god you all praise
Walks the earth and shatters trees
You huddle close beside my gift
And whisper prayers beside the spit
And as the woodsmoke turns and twists
You owe your lives to sly Loki.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
I am the slyest of the gods
Fire is the gift I gave
I am swifter than the wind
And none can match the tricks I've played
But when that storm god you all praise
Walks the earth and shatters trees
You huddle close beside my gift
And whisper prayers beside the spit
And as the woodsmoke turns and twists
You owe your lives to sly Loki.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
What is the honor they give me?
Denied a seat in Odin's hall
Forbidden fruits from Idun's tree
And cast outside of Asgard's walls
But when that storm god you all praise
Walks the earth and shatters trees
You huddle close beside my gift
And whisper prayers beside the spit
And as the woodsmoke turns and twists
You owe your lives to sly Loki.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>
So sit beside the fires gleam
And count the wrongs that I have borne
I wait for Ragnarok and dream
Hark! Is that the battles horn?
