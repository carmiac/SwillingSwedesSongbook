    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
The minstrel boy to the war is gone
In the ranks of death you'll find him.
His father's sword he has girded on
His wild harp slung behind him.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
&quot;Land of song,&quot; sang the warrior bard,
&quot;Tho all the world betrays ye,
One sword at least thy rights shall guard,
One faithful harp shall praise thee.&quot;
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
The minstrel fell, but the foeman's chains
could not keep his proud soul under.
The harp he bore ne'er spoke again
For he tore its cords asunder...
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
And said &quot;No chains shall sully thee,
Thou soul of love and bravery,
Thy songs were made for the pure and free,
They ne'er shall sound in slavery.&quot;
</lines>
