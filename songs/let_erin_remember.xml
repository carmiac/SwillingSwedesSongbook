    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
Let Erin remember the days of old,
Ere her faithless sons betray'd her,
When Malachi wore the collar of gold,
Which he won from her proud invader;
When her kings, with standard of green unfurl'd,
Led the Red-Branch knights to danger;
Ere the em'rald gem of the western world
Was set in the crown of a stranger.

    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
On Lough Neagh's band, as the fisherman strays,
When the clear cold eve's declining,
He sees the round tow'rs of other days
In the wave beneath him shining!
Thus shall mem'ry often, in dreams sublime,
Catch a glimpse of the days that are over;
Thus sighing, look thro' the waves of Time
For the long faded glories they cover!
