  <lyrics>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
I stand here now before you
A shy and modest man,
A simple song to sing you
As chivalry demands;
But I find the place uncommon,
Before a crowd to sing,
For I am a simple
Soldier of the king.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
There are some among my siblings
Who tell a wondrous tale
Of brave deeds and maidens
And heroes where they fell.
Their stories are beguiling,
And wisdom from them springs;
And I am a simple
Soldier of the king.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
Others of my siblings,
Their voices fill the night:
Dancing tunes and fancy,
Their songs of pure delight.
But though my song is quiet,
The words ring no less true:
From my heart, eternal springs
The love I have for you.
