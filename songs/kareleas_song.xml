    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
Now, the Baron of the East March's fair sorceress daughter
Was enamored, unseemly with the fool of her Lord.
Now her Duke was deemed handsome, he'd a soul vain and petty
And a dark mind as empty as last summer's gourd.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
And the fool, he was clever and he sang for the Lady
Like a nightingale piping in a deep forest grove.
But his station was lowly and his body was aging
And their love was as helpless as if he were stone.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
So the Lady has led them, the fool and her husband
To her cool secret garden by the mid summer's moon
And she's dance them a spell there of shifting and changing
And left them dumbfounded by sorcery's boon.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
She has left the fool crying to the gods of his fathers'
She has led her Duke laughing to her high chamber door.
And she's kept him there softly for two days bright dawnings
While the servants all gossiped in wonder and awe.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>
Now, the fool died in madness, saying he was ensorceled
And the Duke only smiled him a sad secret smile.
Now, the Duke rules his people in wit and good humor
And he sings for his Lady like the nightingale's' song.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>
And she's born him five children, two sons and three daughters
And they've grown straight and handsome and sorcerers all.
And they dance in the garden and sing in the moonlight
Like nightingale's singing in a green forest hall.
</lines>
