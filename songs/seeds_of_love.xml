    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
I sowed the seeds of love,
And I sowed them in the spring.
I gathered them up in the morning so soon,
While the small birds so sweetly sing.
While the small birds so sweetly sing.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
My garden was planted well
With flowers ev'ry where,
But I had not the liberty to choose for my self
Of the flow'rs that I loved so dear,
Of the flow'rs that I loved so dear,
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
The gard'ner was standing by,
And I asked him to choose for me.
He chose for me the violet, the lily, and the pink,
But those I refused all three.
But those I refused all three.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
The violet I did not like
Because it bloomed so soon.
The lily and the pink I really over think,
So I vowed I would wait `til June.
So I vowed I would wait `til June.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>
In June there was a red rose bud,
And that is the flow'r for me.
I often time have pluck'd that red rose bud
Till I gain'd the willow tree.
Till I gain'd the willow tree.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>
The willow tree will twist,
And the willow tree will twine.
I often time have wished I were in that young man's arms
That once had the heart of mine.
That once had the heart of mine.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v7">
      <lines>
Come all you false young men.
Do not leave me here to complain,
For the grass that has often time been trampled under foot,
Give it time. It will rise again.
Give it time. It will rise again.
</lines>
