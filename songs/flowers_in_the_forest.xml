    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
I heard them lilting, at the morning milking
The lassies a-lilting before the dawn of day
Now they are mourning, their men not returning
The flowers of the forest are stolen away
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
Faith in our order sent our lads to the border
The English for once by deceit won the day
The flowers of the forest, the bravest, the foremost
The pride of our country, lie cold in the clay
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
There'll be no more lilting at the evening milking
No laughter, no lightness the long summer day
But weeping and mourning, for lovers not returning
The flowers of the forest are vanished away
</lines>
