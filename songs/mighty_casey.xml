    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
The field was terribly vicious
For the tourney list that day
A Baby Knight from Ansteorra
Seemed poised to have his way
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
So when Jago was one-shotted
And Bertrond had lost both arms
A mood of deep depression
Fell over the Outlands Charms
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
The lesser fighters bereft of lives
Made way back to the camp
But the older Outlands fighters
Would stay to see the champ
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
They said &quot;If only Casey
Had had a chance to fight
We'd have a chance to win our luck
Against this Rhino-Hide
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>
Then suddenly their eyes lit up
A cry rose from their Lords
It echoed off the polearms
It rattled off the swords
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>
It rumbled through the valley
Where Outlandish fighters healed
For Casey, Mighty Casey
Was about to take the field
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v7">
      <lines>
His helm was brightly shining
His leathers richly tanned
His breastplate layered titanium
(Which cost him half a grand)
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v8">
      <lines>
The shield upon his mighty arm
Was golden from afar
Between his teeth he coolly clenched
A really good cigar
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v9">
      <lines>
The Outlands fighters now revived
Together in one light
Would cheer the mighty Casey on
In this, his greatest fight
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v10">
      <lines>
There was ease in Casey's manner
As his new opponent met
His hands were steady as a rock
His brow was free of sweat
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v11">
      <lines>
&quot;One quick blow&quot; he murmured
As he looked up to the sky
Then bowing only to his Queen
He launched into the fight
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v12">
      <lines>
The cool is drained from Casey's face
His eyes are hard and keen
And all along his sun-drenched brow
Great furrows can be seen
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v13">
      <lines>
And now he calmly grips his sword
And now he makes his throw
And Now The Air Is SHATTERED
By the force of Casey's blow
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v14">
      <lines>
Oh somewhere in the Knowne Worlde
There is a Happy Place
Where Gentle Lords and Ladies
Lie oblivious in their grace
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v15">
      <lines>
But there is no joy in the Outlands
Upon this sultry night
For the foe of Mighty Casey
Has called his great blow &quot;Light&quot;
</lines>
    </verse>
