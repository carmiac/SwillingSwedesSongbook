    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
'Tis of a brave young highwayman, this story I will tell
His name was Willie Brennan and in Ireland he did dwell
It was on the Kilwood Mountain that he commenced his wild career
And many a wealthy nobleman before him shook with fear.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>
It was Brennan on the moor, Brennan on the moor.
Bold, brave and undaunted, was young Brennan on the moor.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
One day upon the highway as young Willie he went down,
He met the mayor of Cashiell, a mile outside of town.
The mayor he knew his features, and he said, &quot;Young man&quot;, said he
Your name is Willie Brennan, you must come along with me.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
Now Brennan's wife had gone to town, provisions for to buy;
And when she saw her Willie, she commenced to weep and cry.
He said, &quot;Hand to me that tenpenny&quot;, as soon as Willie spoke,
She handed him a blunderbuss from underneath her cloak.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
Now with this loaded blunderbuss, the truth I will unfold
He made the mayor to tremble, and he robbed him of his gold.
One hundred pounds was offered for his apprehension there
So he, with horse and saddle to the mountains did repair.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>
Now Brennan being an outlaw, upon the mountains high.
With cavalry and infantry to take him they did try.
He laughed at them with scorn until at last 'twas said:
By a false-hearted woman, he was cruelly betrayed.
</lines>
