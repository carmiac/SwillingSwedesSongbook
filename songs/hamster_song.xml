  <lyrics>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
Fighting hamsters from the sky
Some will live and some will die
Hamsters have nothing to fear
The fighting hamsters of Calontir
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
Silver tape upon their backs
A broadsword is all they lack
Fifty hamsters fight a war
They won't win without fifty more
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
Trained by jumping off a roof
Trained in combat tooth to tooth
Hamsters fight both far and near
The fighting hamsters of Calontir
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
Riding high upon our helms
Their war cry it overwhelms
All opponents become weak
At their fearsome squeaky squeak
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>
Back at home Paval waits
His fighting hamster has met its fate
He has died while drinking beer
The fighting hamsters of Calontir
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>
Once again its off to war
This time we number a dozen more
We will fight for those in need
so this year it's with Caid
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v7">
      <lines>
Fighting hamsters jump from planes
Fighting hamsters fall like rain
Some will live but most will die
Stupid creatures cannot fly
</lines>
    </verse>
