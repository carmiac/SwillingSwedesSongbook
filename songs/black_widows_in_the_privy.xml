    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
Everyone knows someone we'd be better off without,
But best not mention names for we don't know who's about
But why commit a murder and risk the fires of hell,
When black widows in the privy can do it just as well.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
Now poison's good, and daggers, and arrows in the back,
And if you are really desperate you can try a front attack,
But are they really worthy of the risk of being caught
When black widows in the privy need not be bribed or bought?
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
So if there's one, of whom you wish most simply to be rid,
Just wait until dark then point the way to where the widow is hid,
<comment>spoken:</comment>&quot;I think you'll find that this one is the best.&quot;
And black widows in the privy will gladly do the rest.
