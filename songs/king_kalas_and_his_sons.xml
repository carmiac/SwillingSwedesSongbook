      <lines>
King Kalas had four sons,
And four sons had he,
And they rambled around
In the northern countrie
And they rambled around
Without ever a care.
The Hound and the Bull
And the Cat and the Bear.

The Hound was a hunter,
The Hound was a spy,
The Hound could shoot down
Any bird on the fly.
The Hound was out hunting
When brought down was he
Alone as he rambled
The northern countrie.

King Kalas had three sons,
And three sons had he,
And they rambled around
In the northern countrie
And they rambled around
Without ever a care.
And they were the Bull
And the Cat and the Bear.

The Bull was a gorer,
The Bull was a knight,
And never a man who would
Run from a fight.
The Bull was out fighting
When brought down was he
Alone as he rambled
The northern countrie.

King Kalas had two sons,
And two sons had he,
And they rambled around
In the northern countrie
And they rambled around
Without ever a care.
And the names they were called
Were the Cat and the Bear.

The Cat was a shadow,
The Cat was a snare,
Sometimes you knew not
When the Cat was right there.
The Cat was out hiding
When brought down was he
Alone as he rambled
The northern countrie.

King Kalas had one son,
And one son had he,
And he rambled around in the northern countrie.
And he rambled around without ever a care,
And the name he went under
Was Kalas' Bear.

The Bear was a bully,
The Bear was a brag,
His mouth was brimmed over
With bluster and swag.
The Bear was out boasting
When brought down was he
Alone as he rambled
The northern countrie.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c5">
      <lines>
King Kalas had no sons,
And no sons had he,
To ramble around
In the northern countrie.
Though late in the evening
The ghosts are seen there
Of the Hound and the Bull
And the Cat and the Bear.
