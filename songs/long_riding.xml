    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
Into the valley
Come riding, come riding,
Into the meadow and into the dell,
Into the moonlight where shadows are gliding,
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>
Into the forest where enemies hiding,
Riding riding,
Three come a riding
Three come a riding
Into the mouth of hell.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
Into the village,
Come riding, come riding,
Into the hames where the sweet women dwell,
Into the rests where the men are a biding.
</lines>
