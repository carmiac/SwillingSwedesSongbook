    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
The most chivalrous fish of the ocean,
To ladies forbearing and mild,
Though his record be dark
Is the man-eating shark
Who will eat neither woman nor child.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
He dines upon seamen and skippers,
And tourists his hunger assuage,
And a fresh cabin boy
Will inspire him with joy
If he's past the maturity age.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
A doctor, a lawyer, a preacher,
He'll gobble one any fine day,
But the ladies, God bless 'em.
He'll only address 'em
Politely and go on his way.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
I can readily cite you an instance
Where a lovely young lady of Breem,
Who was tender and sweet
And delicious to eat,
Fell into the bay with a scream.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>
She struggled and flounced in the water
And signaled in vain for her bark,
And she'd surely been drowned
If she hadn't been found
By a chivalrous man-eating shark.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>
He bowed in a manner most polished.
Thus soothing her impulses wild:
&quot;Don't be frightened,&quot; he said,
I've been properly bred
And I eat neither woman nor child.&quot;
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v7">
      <lines>
Then he proffered his fin and she took it-
Such a gallantry none can dispute-
While the passengers cheered
As the vessel they neared
And a broadside was fired in salute.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v8">
      <lines>
And they soon stood alongside the vessel,
When a life-saving dinghy was lowered
With the pick of the crew,
And her relatives too,
And the mate and the skipper aboard.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v9">
      <lines>
So they took her aboard in a jiffy
And the shark stood at attention the while,
Then he raised on his flipper
And ate up the skipper
And went on his way with a smile.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v10">
      <lines>
And this shows that the prince of the ocean,
To ladies forbearing and mild,
Though his record be dark,
Is the man-eating shark
Who will eat neither woman nor child
</lines>
    </verse>
