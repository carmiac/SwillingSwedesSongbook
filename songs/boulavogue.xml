    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
At Boulavogue, as the sun was setting
O'er the bright May meadows of Shalmaleer
A rebel hand set the heather blazing
And brought the neighbors from far and near.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
Then Father Murphy, from old Kilcormac,
Spurred up the rocks with a warning cry.
&quot;Arm, Arm.&quot; He cried, &quot;For I've come to lead you
For Ireland's freedom we'll fight or die.&quot;
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
He leads us on 'gains the coming soldiers,
The cowardly yeomen we put to flight.
'Twas at the Hara, the boys of Wexford showed
Bougie's regiment old men could fight.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
Look out for hirelings King George of England,
Search every Kingdom that breeds a slave
For Father Murphy, from County Wexford,
Sweeps o'er the land like a mighty wave.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>
At Vinegar Hill o'er the Pleasant Slane,
Our heroes bravely stood back to back.
And the Youls at Tulla took Father Murphy
And burned his body upon the rack.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>
God grant you glory Father Murphy
And open heaven to all your men,
For the cause that called you,
May call tomorrow in another fight for the green again.
</lines>
