    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
Where have all my children gone?
It didn't seem I'd slept so long.
All the beauty's gone away;
It was here just yesterday.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
Butterflies no longer sing,
Faerie bells no longer ring.
Gone the dancers of the mist;
Mortals whom the gods once kissed.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
No more riders in the sky.
Never more shall dragons fly.
Stranger can you tell me why
All I've ever loved has died?
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
Who are you who walk this land?
Death is happy in your hand.
You pretend that I'm not real,
Not believing what you feel.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>
I'm tempted to strike you down,
Don again my crystal crown;
Take you back to yesterday...
But, instead, I think I'll just go away....
</lines>
