    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
Leprosy,
All my skin is falling off of me
And it's simple, very plain to see
I've got a case of Leprosy
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
Leprosy,
Friends and family shy away from me
And I can't afford a colony
Oh I am stuck with Leprosy
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>
Why I have to rot, I know not
I cannot say
Gangrene is better but
I am stuck, with Leprosy
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
Leprosy,
All my clothes are dirty rags you see
That's why all the people stare at me
Oh why do I have Leprosy
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c2">
      <lines>
Why I have to rot, I know not
I cannot say
Gangrene is better but
I am stuck with Leprosy
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
Leprosy,
I'm not half the man I used to be
That's 'cause half of me is dead you see
Oh I am plagued with Leprosy
