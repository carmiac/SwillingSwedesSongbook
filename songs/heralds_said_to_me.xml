      <lines>
The first time I sent my device the heralds said to me:
It violates the Rule of Three
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
The next time I tried it, the heralds said to me:
We changed the forms, and
It violates the Rule of Three!
<comment>...to save space...</comment>

    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
The LAST time I sent my device, the heralds said to me:
Someone else has got it,
We changed the rules again,
It's not a period design,
It's against the Rule of Tincture,
We changed the rules,
<comment>In a fast Gregorian Monotone</comment>
In a decision rendered by the College of Arms
on August 1'st, A.S. V it was decided that this
Style of Heraldic Design was not appropriate to
the aims and intentions of the Corporate Body
Holy! Holy! Holy!
<comment>Back to singing</comment>
We haven't got it,
We upped the fees,
We changed the forms, and
It violates the Rule of Three
