    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
Down on the quarter deck and walking about,
There is the second mate so steady and so stout;
What he is a-thinkin' of he doesn't know himself
And we wish that he would hurry up and strike, strike the bell.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>
Strike the bell second mate, let us go below;
Look ya well to windward you can see it's gonna blow;
Look at the glass, you can see it has fell,
Oh we wish that you would hurry up and strike, strike the bell.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
Down on the main deck and workin' at the pumps,
There is the starboard watch just longing for their bunks;
Look out to windward, and see a great swell,
And we wish that you would huffy up and strike, strike the bell
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
Forward on the forecastle head and keepin' sharp lookout,
Yonder Johnson standin', a-longin' fer to shout,
Lights' a-burnin' bright sir and everything is well,
And he's wishin' that the second mate would strike, strike the bell.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
Aft at the wheelhouse old Anderson stands,
Graspin' at the helm with his frostbitten hands,
Lookin' at the compass through the course is clear as hell
And he's wishin' that the second mate would strike, strike the bell.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>
Aft on the quarter deck our gallant captain stands,
Starin' out to sea with a spyglass in his hand,
What he is a-thinkin' of we know very well,
He's thinkin' more of shortenin' sail than strikin' the bell.
