    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
Bainbridge Town in the County Down
One mornin' last July
From a boreen green came a sweet Colleen
She looked so sweet from her two bare feet
To the sheen of her nut brown hair
Such a coaxing elf, sure I shook myself
For to see I was really there
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>
From Bantry Bay up to Derry Quay and
From Galway to Dublin Town
No maid I've seen like brown Colleen
That I met in the County Down
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
As she onward sped, sure I scratched my head
And I looked with a feelin' rare
And I says, says I, to a passer by
Who's the maid with the nut brown hair?
He smiled at me and he says, says he
That's the gem of Ireland's crown
It's Rosie McCann from the banks of the Bann
She's the star of the County Down
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
At the Harvest Fair she'll be surely there
And I'll dress in my Sunday clothes
With my shoes shone bright and my hat cocked
Right for a smile from my nut brown rose
No pipe I'll smoke, no horse I'll yoke
'Till my plow turns rust colored brown
'Till a smilin' bride, by my own fireside
Sits the star of the County Down
</lines>
    </verse>
