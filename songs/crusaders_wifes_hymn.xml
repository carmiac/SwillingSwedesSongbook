    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
O, I am a lady, my husband's a lord.
A true knightly warrior, and God! I am bored.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
The knights are called gentle and by birth they are.
But I prefer minstrels, they're sweeter by far.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
He's fearless in melees, he's first at the chase.
But when around ladies, falls flat on his face.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
He curses most roundly, and colorfully too.
But ask him for soft words, he hasn't a clue.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>
My lord is a true knight, fights rather than thinks.
Excepting in battle, his swordsmanship stinks.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>
My lord is crusading, I shall at home stay.
And I'll not be pining while he is away.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v7">
      <lines>
But my lord can trust me, I care not to roam.
The lay of the minstrel will keep me at home!
</lines>
    </verse>
