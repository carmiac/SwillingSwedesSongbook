    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
She's leaned her back against an oak,
All alone in the lailey O',
She's pushed, and she's pushed till her backs near broke.
Down in the bonny green Osireo.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
She's leaned her head against a thorn,
All alone in the lailey O',
The two bonniest babes that ever were born.
Down in the bonny green Osireo.

      <lines>
She's gone back to her fathers castle hall,
She was the smallest maid of them all.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
She looks over her father's castle wall,
She sees two babes a' playin' at the ball.

    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>
O, bonny babes if you were mine,
I'd give you bread, and I'd give you wine.

    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>
Mother Dear Mother, when we were thine,
Around our necks you pulled the twine.

    <verse name="v7">
      <lines>
Now we are in the heaven so High,
And in hells fires you shall die.
