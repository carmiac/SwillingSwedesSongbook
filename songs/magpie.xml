    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
The magpie is a most illustrious bird,
Dwells in a diamond tree,
One brings sorrow and one brings joy,
Sorrow and joy for me.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
The magpie is a most royal bird,
Black and blue as night,
Would that I had feathers three,
Black and blue and white.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
Two magpies alighted on a rampart ledge,
Just as the sun broke red,
The siege is over and my lord returns,
But my brother in the field lays dead,
My brother in the field lays dead.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
I saw the gentle magpie birds,
In dusky yester eve,
One brought sorrow and one brought joy,
And sooner than soon did leave,
Brought sorrow and joy for me,
Sorrow and joy for me.
</lines>
