    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
By Estrella Mountain, so far, far, away
I'll tell you a story that happened one day.
About a young girl, her age was sixteen,
And she carried a banner: white stag on green.

    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
Well, a young Aten soldier drove his golf cart that way
And he spied the young girl, with her banner so gay
He laughed and he joked and got off his machine
Determined to capture: white stag on green.

    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
And he paused as she drew her rapier so keen,
Saying, I fight for the honor of the Outlandish Queen.
And I'll fight with a fervor that's rarely been seen
To defend that banner: white stag on green.Ã®
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
Well, the young Aten soldier turned white as the snow,
Got on his machine and away he did go,
Cause you can't win when fighting a girl of sixteen,
Who'll die for a banner: white stag on green.
