    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
Farewell ye dungeons dark and strong.
Farewell, farewell to thee;
McPherson's life will not be long
On yonder gallows tree.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>
Sae rantingly, sae wantonly, and sae dauntingly gaed he;
He played a tune and he danced around below the gallows tree.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
Take off these bands from off my hands
And give to me my sword,
For there's not a man in all Scotland
But I'd brave him at his word.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
There's some come here for to see me hung,
And some to buy my fiddle;
But before that I do part with her,
I'll break her through the middle
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
He took his fiddle in both his hands,
And he broke it o'er a stove,
Saying, there's nay ither hand shall play on thee
When I am dead and gone.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>
The reprieve was coming o'er the Brig of Baniff,
For to set McPherson free;
But they put the clock a quarter before,
And they hanged him from a tree.
</lines>
