    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
When first unto this country a stranger I came
I placed my affections on a maid that was young
She being fair and tender, her waist small an' slender
Kind nature had formed her for my overthrow
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
On the banks of the Bann is where I first beheld her
She appeared like Regina, the fair Grecian Queen
Her eyes shone like diamonds, or stars softly shining
Her lips were like roses, or blood drops on snow
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
It was her cruel parents, who first caused her variance
Because she was rich and above my degree
But I do endeavor to gain my loves favor
Although she is born of a high family
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
My name it is Delahney, it's a name that won't shame me
If I ha' had money, I'd ha' never had roamed
But the drinking and sporting, an rambling and courting
Are the cause of all my ruin and me absence from home
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>
But now that I have gained her, I am happy forever
With rings on her finger, and gold in her hair
And now by the banks of the lovely Bann waters
In peace and contentment I'll live with my dear
</lines>
