    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
Now Lindsay he has taken to the road, straight to the North he'll steer
With his face and a fiddle in his pack, he'll make a living it's clear
He's well met with a peddler group, and a chance to a chance at the Inn
He's called to the rail, and he's taken the fife, and he's careful to stick to the tune
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
Now all through the night they fiddle and fife, for the dancers have taken to the floor
They neither one took a pipe or a glass, or a lass while the music was on
They played up through the markets and fairs, till a glance to the north they've come
And there they met Black Janet De'Willie, who sang as she rattled a drum
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
Now Lindsay's asked Black Janet to dance, and ye never saw so bonny a pair
She has taken him firm by the hand, and she's kicked to the top of the stair
&quot;Here&quot;, she said, &quot;is a fine feather bed, where a man be weary or creel
May step for me against Strathspey, Wi' me lute and the tune in his ears
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
Now Janet was as good as her word, Lindsay has proven his worth
May ye all have so merry a dance if ever ye come to the north
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>
Now Lindsay he has taken to the road, straight to the Northhill still
With his face and a fiddle in his pack, he'll make a living its clear
He's well met with a peddler group, and a chance to a chance at the Inn
He' called to the rail, and he's taken the fife, and he's careful to stick to the tune
</lines>
