    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
In a shady nook one moonlight night
A leprechaun I spied,
With scarlet cap and coat of green;
A cruiskenn by his side.
'Twas a tick tack tick, his hammer went,
Upon a tiny shoe,
And I laughed to think of a purse of gold;
But the fairy was laughing too!
</lines>

    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
With a tip toe step and beating heart,
Quite softly I drew nigh:
There was mischief in his merry face;
A twinkle in his eye.
He hammered and sang with tiny voice,
And drank his mountain dew;
And I laughed to think he was caught at last:
But the fairy was laughing too!
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
As quick as thought I seized the elf;
&quot;Your fairy purse!&quot; I cried;
&quot;The purse!&quot; he said &quot;'tis in her hand
&quot;That lady at your side!&quot;
I turned to look: the elf was off!
Then what was I to do?
O, I laughed to think what a fool I'd been;
And the fairy was laughing too!
