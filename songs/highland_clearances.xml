    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
Ah, for the glens are lyin' bare,
And the wee bit farm deserted,
And the woods of Germany,
Grows in rows o'er the broken hearted.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
Black is the wood on the roofance was braw
But blacker still is your heart, Victoria,
Sent your men untae our glens
You'll need the Good Lord lookin' o'er ye.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
Many hae gane tae Americay
You burnt their hames and garred them wander
Gor a' would have stayed wi' the deil himsel'
As bide an hour wi' the cruel Gillanders.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
Ah, for the glens are lyin' bare
And the wee bit farm deserted
And the woods of Germany
Grows on rows o'er the broken hearted.
