An old man came courtin'me
Hi ding durham di
An old man came courtin'me, me bein'young
An old man came courtin'me, askin'to marry me
Maids when you're young, never wed an old man
</lines>

    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>
He's got no fallorum, Fie diddle nie durham die
He's got no fallorum, Fie diddle aye a'
He's got no fallorum, he's lost his ding durham
Maids when you're young never wed an old man
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
And when we went to tea
Hi ding durham die
And when we went to tea, me bein'young
And when we went to tea, he started strokin'me
Maids when you're young never wed an old man
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
And when we went to church
Hi ding durham die
And when we went to church, me bein'young
And when we went to church, he left me in the lurch
Maids when you're young never wed an old man
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
And when we went to bed
Hi ding durham die
And when we went to bed, me bein'young
And when we went to bed, he lay there as if were dead
Maids when you're young never we an old man
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>
And when he went to sleep
Hi ding durham die
And when he went to sleep, me bein'young
And when he went to sleep, out of bed I did creep
Into the arms of a virile young lad
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>
Guess what?
I found my fallorum, hie diddle lie durham die
I found my fallorum, Hie diddle aye a'
I found my fallorum, I've got my ding durham
Maids when you're young never wed an old man
