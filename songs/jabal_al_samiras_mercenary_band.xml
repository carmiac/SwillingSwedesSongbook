It's wonderful to be here,
It's certainly a thrill,
You're such a lovely audience,
Your ransom we'll take home with us,
Your ransom we'll take home.

I don't really want to stop the show,
But we thought you really ought to know,
To escape us, you must pay a fee,
Call it ransom money if you please.

The head of our conspiracy,
al-Samira's Mercenary Band.
Pay your FEES!
