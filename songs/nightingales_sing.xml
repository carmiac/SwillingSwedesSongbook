    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
One morning, one morning, one morning in May
I spied a young couple, a goin' this way
One was a lady, a lady so fair
The other a soldier, a brave Grenadier.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
Good morning, good morning, good morning to thee
O where are you going, my pretty lady?
O, I'm going to walk to the banks of the sea;
To see waters gliding, hear the nightingales sing.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
They had not been standing but a moment or two
When out of his knapsack a fiddle he drew
And the tune that he played made the valleys to ring
&quot;Hark! Hark!&quot; cried the lady, &quot;hear the nightingales sing.&quot;
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
&quot;Pretty lady, pretty lady, it's time to give o'er&quot;
&quot;O no&quot;, cried the lady,&quot;please play one tune more
I'd rather hear your fiddle, and the touch of one string
Than to see waters gliding, hear the nightingales sing.&quot;
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>
&quot;O soldier, O soldier, will you marry me?&quot;
'O no, pretty lady, that never can be
I've a wife in old England and children twice three
Two wives in the army's too many for me.&quot;
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>
&quot;I'll go back to London and stay for a year
And drink wine and whiskey, instead of small beer
But if ever I return it'll be in the spring
Just to see waters gliding, hear the nightingales sing.&quot;
</lines>
