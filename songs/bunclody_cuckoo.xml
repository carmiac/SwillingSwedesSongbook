    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
Oh were I at the moss house where the birds do increase
At the foot of the Mount Leinster or some silent place
Near the streams of Bunclody where all pleasures do meet
And all I would ask is one kiss from my sweet.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>
Oh the cuckoo is a pretty bird and it sings as it flies
It brings us good tidings and it tells us no lies
It sucks the young birds eggs to make its voice clear
And it never cries Cuckoo 'till the summer is near.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
Oh if I were a clerk and could write a good hand
I would write my love a letter so she'd understand
I am a young fellow who's wounded in love
I live in Bunclody but now I must leave.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
If I was a singing bird then I would fly
To yon shady arbor where my true love does lie
I'd sing her a sweet song and maybe she'd cry
Then on her soft bosom contented I'd die.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
My love always slights me as you understand
Because she has riches and I have no land
I'm going to America my fortune to try
But when I think on Bunclody I am ready to die.
