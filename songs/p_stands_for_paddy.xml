    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>
P stands for Paddy I suppose, J for my love John
And W stands for smart William, Johnny is the fairest lad
Johnny is the fairest lad me dear, Johnny is the fairest lad
Well I don't care what anybody says, Johnny is the fairest lad

    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
As I went out one May mornin', to take a pleasant walk
I sat myself down by an old stone wall to hear two lovers talk
To hear what they might say my dear, to hear what they might say
That I might know a little more about life before I go my way
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
Let me sit you down beside me now, not now nor any other time
For I hear you've met another little lad, an' your hearts no longer mine
Your hearts no longer mine my love, your hearts no longer mine
For I have met another little lad, an' your hearts no longer mine
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
I'll go and climb a tall high tree, and steal a wild bird's nest
And when I come home I'll know a little more about the girl that I love best
The girl that I love best my dear, the girl that I love best
And when I come down I'll know a little more about the girl that I love best
