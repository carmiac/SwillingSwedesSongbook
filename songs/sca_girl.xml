    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
Well I went down to Citadel
And I slept in a park
Went on up to Caer Mithen
For a tourney in the dark
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>
And I'll search the world over
For my Lady in Garb
Yeah, I'll search the world over
For an SCA Girl
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
Cruised on out to Outlandish
Nearly blew me away
Yeah, the wind there was awful
But I stayed anyway
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
Got drunk at St. Golias
They put me up for the night
Now I always have liked them
The way they drink, and they fight
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
Called my Knight from a pay phone
Said I'm down to my last
He said &quot;I gave you your armor
Now go call your dad&quot;
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>
And the Duchess that he married
Well she hung up the phone
No she never did like me
But I can stand on my own
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>
Sold my armor at Pennsic
Spent it all in one night
Buyin' drinks in a tavern
For a guy who don't fight
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v7">
      <lines>
Cruised on out to Estrella
Atens piped on the field
Yeah they still lost the war though
Never had time to yield
</lines>
    </verse>
