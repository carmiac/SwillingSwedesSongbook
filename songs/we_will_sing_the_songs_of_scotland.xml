    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>
We will sing the songs of Scotland
Now that we are gathered here
We will sing the songs of Scotland,
Oh this land we hold so dear
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c2">
      <lines>
Of the Hielan's and the Lowlands,
We will sing them all and then
Just because we love them,
We will sing them all again
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
There are stirring, spirit songs of war
Where we march the gallant man
There are songs of hearth and home
Of the mountain and the glen
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
There are songs of joy to make us glad
And song of sadness too
And sweet the songs of love
And they all belong to you
</lines>
