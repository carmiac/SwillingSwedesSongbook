The keeper would a hunting go,
And under his coat he carried a bow,
All for to shoot at the merry little doe,
Among the leaves so green, O

Jackie bo! Master? Sing ye well?
Very well.
Hey down! Ho down!
Derry derry down!
Among the leaves so green, O.
To my hey down!
To my ho, down, down!
Hey down!
Ho down!
Derry derry down.
Among the leaves so green, O!

      <lines>
The first doe he shot at he missed
The second one he trimmed and kissed.
The third one went where nobody wist,
Among the leaves so green, O!

      <lines>
The forth doe, she did cross the plain
The keeper fetched her back again.
Where she is now she may remain,
Among the leaves so green, O!

      <lines>
The fifth doe, she did cross the brook
The keeper fetched her back with his crook.
Where she is now, you must go look,
Among the leaves so green, O!
</lines>

    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>
The sixth doe she ran over the plain,
But he with his hounds did turn her again,
And it's there he did hunt in a merry, merry vein,
Among the leaves so green, O!
