    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
Pale was the wounded knight
That bore the rowan shield
Loud and cruel were the raven's cries
That feasted on the field, saying:
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
Beck water, cold and clear,
Will never clean you wound.
There's none but the Maid of the Winding Mere
Can make thee hale and soond.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
So course well, my brindled hounds,
And fetch me the mountain hare
Whose coat is a grey as the Wastwater
Or as white as the lily fair, who said
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
Green moss and heather bands
Will never staunch the flood.
There's none but the Witch of the West-mer-lands
Can save thy dear life's blood.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>
So turn, turn you stallion's head
Till his red mane flies in the wind
And the rider of the moon gaes by
And the bright star falls behind.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>
And clear was the paley moon
When his shadow passed him by;
Below the hill was the brightest star
When he heard the houlet cry, saying
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v7">
      <lines>
Why do you ride this way,
And wharfore cam' ye here?
I seek the Witch of the West-mer-lands
That dwells by the winding mere.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v8">
      <lines>
Then fly free your good grey hawk
To gather the golden rod,
And face your horse into the clouds
Above yon gay green wood.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v9">
      <lines>
And it's weary by Ullswater
And the misty brake fern way
Till through the cleft o' the Kirkstane Pass
The winding water lay.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v10">
      <lines>
He said, Lie down, my brindled hound,
And rest my good grey hawk,
And thee, my steed, may graze thy fill,
For I must dismount and walk.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v11">
      <lines>
But come when you hear my horn
And answer swift the call,
For I fear e'er the sun shall rise this morn
You will serve me best of all.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v12">
      <lines>
And down to the water's brim
He's borne the rowan shield,
And the golden rod he has cast in
To see what the lake might yield.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v13">
      <lines>
And wet rose she from the lake,
And fast and fleet gaed she,
One half the form of a maiden fair
With a jet black mare's body.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v14">
      <lines>
And loud, long, and shrill he blew
And his steed was by his side;
High overhead his grey hawk flew
And swiftly he did ride, saying:
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v15">
      <lines>
Course well, my brindled hounds,
And fetch me the jet black mare.
Stoop and strike, my good grey hawk,
And bring me the maiden fair.  She said:
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v16">
      <lines>
Pray sheath thy silvery sword,
Lay down thy rowan shield,
For I see by the briny blood that flows
You've been wounded in the field.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v17">
      <lines>
And she stood in a gown of the velvet blue,
Bound 'round with a silver chain.
She's kissed his pale lips aince and twice
And three time 'round again.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v18">
      <lines>
And she's bound his wound with the golden rod;
Full fast in her arms he lay,
And he has risen hale and soond
Wi' the sun high in the day.  She said:
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v19">
      <lines>
Ride with you brindled hounds at heel
And your good grey hawk in hand.
There's nane can harm a knight wha's lain
With the Witch of the West-mer-land.
</lines>
