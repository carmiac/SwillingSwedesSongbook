    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>
Well it's all for me grog, me jolly, jolly grog
It's all for my beer and tobacco
For I spent all me tin with the lasses drinkin' gin
Far across the Western Ocean I must wander
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
Where are me boots, me noggin', noggin' boots
They're all sold for beer and tobacco
See the soles they were thin and the uppers were lettin' in
And the heels were lookin' out for better weather
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
Where is me shirt, me noggin', noggin' shirt
It's all sold for beer and tobacco
You see the sleeves were all worn out and the collar been torn about
And the tail was lookin' out for better weather
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
Where is me wife, me noggin', noggin' wife
She's all sold for beer and tobacco
You see her front it was worn out and her tail I kicked about
And I'm sure she's lookin' out for better weather
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
Where is me bed, me noggin', noggin' bed
It's all sold for beer and tobacco
You see I sold it to the girls until the springs were all in twirls
And the sheets they're lookin' out for better weather
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>
I'm sick in the head and I haven't been to bed
Since first I came ashore with me plunder
I've seen centipedes and snakes and me head is full of aches
And I have to take a path for way out yonder
</lines>
