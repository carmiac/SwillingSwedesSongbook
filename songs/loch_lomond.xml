    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
By yon bonnie banks and by yon bonnie braes
Where the sun shines bright on Loch Lomond,
Where me and my true love were ever wont to gae,
On the bonnie, bonnie banks of Loch Lomond.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>
Oh! Ye'll take the high road, and I'll take the low road,
And I'll be in Scotland afore ye,
But me and my true love we'll never meet again,
On the bonnie, bonnie banks of Loch Lomond.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
'Twas then that we parted, in yon shady glen
On the steep, steep side of Ben Lomond,
Where in purple hue, the Highland hills we view
And the moon coming out in the glooming.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
The wee birdies, and the wildflowers spring
And in sunshine the waters are sleeping,
But the broken heart it kens nae second spring again,
Tho' the waeful may cease frae their grieving.
</lines>
