    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
Johnny Miner, you were born
Never to see the rising dawn,
Now it's time that you were gone,
So farewell, Johnny Miner.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>
Farewell Durham, Yorkshire, too,
Nottingham, the same to you
Scotland, South Wales, bid adieu,
And farewell, Johnny Miner.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
You struggled hard with slate and shale,
Lungs turned black and faces pale,
Now your body's up for sale,
And farewell, Johnny Miner.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
They promised you the earth some time
To work down in their stinkin' mine,
Now the justice for their crime
Is farewell, Johnny Miner.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
Cheer up John, it won't be bad:
Unemployment isn't hard -
They'll treat you well in the knacker's yard,
So farewell, Johnny Miner.
</lines>
