    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
Cheer up, Brian. You know what they say.
Some things in life are bad
They can really make you mad
Other things just make you swear and curse
When you're chewing on life's gristle
Don't grumble, give a whistle
And this'll help things turn out for the best...
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>
And......always look on the bright side of life
(whistle)
Always look on the bright side of life...
(whistle)
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
If life seems jolly rotten
There's something you've forgotten
And that's to laugh and smile and dance and sing,
When you're feeling in the dumps,
Don't be silly chumps
Just purse your lips and whistle--that's the thing.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c2">
      <lines>
And...always look on the bright side of life...
(whistle)
Always look on the right side of life...
(whistle)
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
For life is quite absurd
And death's the final word
You must always face the curtain with a bow
Forget about your sin--give the audiences a grin
Enjoy it--it's your last chance anyhow.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c3">
      <lines>
So always look on the bright side of death
Just before you draw your terminal breath
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
Life's a piece of shit
When you look at it
Life's a laugh and death's a joke, it's true,
You'll see it's all a show,
Keep 'em laughing as you go
Just remember that the last laugh is on you.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c4">
      <lines>
And always look on the bright side of life...
Always look on the right side of life
