      <lines>
My cousin sells shields to the Tuchux
The plywood they're made of is thin;
I'm a doggone good Chiurgeon
My God, how the money rolls in!

My brother is a mercenary
Hiring out to help you win
Since both Kingdoms pay for his wages
My God, how the money rolls in!

      <lines>
The East and the Middle are fighting
Trimaris and others join in
The Dark Horde makes book on the winner
My God, how the money rolls in!

Smilin' Ali is looking for people
To travel a long way with him
To auctions in old Persian markets
My God, how the money rolls in!

    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>
I'm just a poor mercenary
I don't care if we lose or we win
As long as you're still here on payday
My God, how the money rolls in!

      <lines>
Ioseph of Locksley is Celtic,
Ioseph of Locksley is thin,
Ioseph writes satire to order,
My God, how the money rolls in!
