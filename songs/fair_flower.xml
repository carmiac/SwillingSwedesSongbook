    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
A farmers daughter was walkin' alone
Oh but her Robert was easy won
When she heard a Scots prisoner makin' along
Oh and she was the flower of Northumberland
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
An' it's all if a lassie would listen to me
Oh but her Robert was easy won
I would make her a Lady of high degree
If she'd loosen me out of this prison so strong
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
Then she's hastened away to her father's back stock
Oh but her Robert was easy won
She has taken the keys to many a good lock
And she's loosened him out of his prison so strong
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
She's hastened away to her father's stable
Oh but her Robert was easy won
She has taken a horse that was both fleet and able
To carry them both to bonny Scotland
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>
As they were a ridin' across the Scots moor
He said Oh but your Robert was easy won
Get down from the horse you're a brazen faced whore
For now you're the flower of Northumberland
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>
For as I have a wife in my own country
Oh but your Robert was easy won
I no have the time for a lassie like thee
Oh now you're the flower of Northumberland
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v7">
      <lines>
It's a cook in your kitchen I surely will be
Oh but my Robert was easy won
I'd serve your Lady most reverently
For I dare not go back to Northumberland
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v8">
      <lines>
It's a cook in my kitchen ya canna well be
Oh but your Robert was easy won
For my Lady she would na' have servants like thee
So go get ye back to Northumberland
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v9">
      <lines>
Oh but loath was he the lassie to leave
Oh but her Robert was easy won
So he's hired a long horse and he's paid in our blood
To carry her back to Northumberland
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v10">
      <lines>
And when she got in her father did frown
Oh but your Robert was easy won
To be a Scots whore when you're fifteen years old
And you were the flower of Northumberland
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v11">
      <lines>
But when she got in her father did smile
Oh but your Robert was easy won
And you're not the first lass that the Scots have beguiled
And you still are the flower of Northumberland
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v12">
      <lines>
And you will not want bread and you will not want wine
Oh though your Robert was easy won
And you will not want silver to buy you a man
And you still are the flower of Northumberland
</lines>
    </verse>
