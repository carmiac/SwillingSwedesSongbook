    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
The holly and the ivy,
When they are both full grown,
Of all trees that are in the wood,
The holly bears the crown
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>
O, the rising of the sun,
And the running of the deer
The playing of the merry organ,
Sweet singing in the choir.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
The holly bears a blossom,
As white as lily flow'r,
And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ,
To be our dear Saviour
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
The holly bears a berry,
As red as any blood,
And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ,
To do poor sinners good
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
The holly bears a prickle,
As sharp as any thorn,
And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ,
On Christmas Day in the morn
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>
The holly bears a bark,
As bitter as the gall,
And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ,
For to redeem us all
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>
The holly and the ivy,
When they are both full grown,
Of all trees that are in the wood,
The holly bears the crown
