    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
Early early in the spring
I shipped on board to serve my king
I left my dearest, my dear behind
She oft times swore, that her heart was mine
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
Now all the time that sailed the seas
I could not find a moments ease
For thinking of my dearest dear
But never a word of my love did hear
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
At last I sailed into Glasgow town
I searched the streets, both up and down
Inquiring for my dearest dear
But never a word of love did hear
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
I went straight way to her fathers hall
And loudly for my love did call
He said she's married now, she's a rich man's wife
Went to another, for a better full life
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>
Well curse you both, curse the cinder truth
And curse the girl, that won't prove true
And the followers, who did break
Who went to another, for riches sake
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>
But the girl is married, the tide is come
And I will stay, on land no more
I'll sail the seas, till the day I die
Breaking through the waves, rolling mountain high
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v7">
      <lines>
Early early in the spring
I shipped onboard, to serve my king
I left my dearest, my dear behind
She oft time swore that her heart was mine
</lines>
