    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
There is a young maiden who lives all alone
She lives all alone on the shore-o
There's nothing she can find to comfort her mind
But to roam all alone on the shore shore shore
But to roam all alone on the shore
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
T'was of the young captain who sailed the salt sea
Let the wind blow high blow low-o
I will die, I will die the young captain did cry
If I don't have that maid on the shore shore shore
If I don't have that maid on the shore
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
Well I have lots of silver I have lots of gold
I have lots of costly ware-o
I'll divide, I'll divide with my jolly ship's crew
If they row me that maid on the shore shore shore
If they row me that maid on the shore
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
After much persuasion they got her aboard
Let the wind blow high blow low-o
They replaced her away in his cabin below
Here's adieu to all sorrow and care care care
Here's adieu to all sorrow and care
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>
They replaced her away in his cabin below
Let the wind blow high blow low-o
She's so pretty and neat she's so sweet and complete
She sung captain and sailors to sleep sleep sleep
She sung captain and sailors to sleep
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>
Then she robbed him of silver she robbed him of gold
She robbed him of costly ware-o
Then took his broadsword instead of an oar
And paddled away to the shore shore shore
And paddled away to the shore
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v7">
      <lines>
Well me men must be crazy me men must be mad
Me men must deep in despair-o
For to let you away from my cabin so gay
And to paddle your way to the shore shore shore
And paddle your way to the shore
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v8">
      <lines>
Well your men was not crazy your men was not mad
Your men was not deep in despair-o
I deluded your sailors as well as yourself
I'm a maiden again on the shore shore shore
I'm a maiden again on the shore
</lines>
