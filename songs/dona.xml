    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
On a wagon bound for market
There's a calf with a mournful eye
High above him there's a swallow
Winging swiftly through the sky
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>
How the winds are laughing, they laugh with all their might
Laugh and laugh the whole day through and half the summer's night
Dona, Dona, Dona, Dona Dona Dona Dona, Don
Dona, Dona, Dona, Dona Dona Dona Dona, Don
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
&quot;Stop complaining&quot; said the Farmer
&quot;Who told you a calf to be?&quot;
&quot;Why don't you have wings to fly with,
Like the swallow so proud and free?&quot;
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
Calves are easily bound and slaughtered
Never knowing the reason why
But whoever treasures freedom
Like the swallow must learn to fly.
</lines>
