    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
Oh I'm a sturdy Viking lad with hairy chest and chin,
To match my furry armor so you can't tell where they end.
I'm hung just like a horse to keep the ladies satisfied.
And now I've come down from the north to hunt me up a bride.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
I saw you in your father's fields and knew him to be rich.
So I cut his legs off at the knees and tossed him in the ditch.
I plundered all his cattle and took his larder too.
And now I hie me back to Jaul in hopes to marry you.

    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>
Cuz I'm a man,
Viking man,
And what's more,
I think I'm in love.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
I've lots of wealth to offer and that's truly not a boast.
For I've all the wealth of half the farms along the eastern coast.
I slaughtered all your family just to prove to you my heart,
And by your hair I drug you home so we need not be apart.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
I've have many servants that will also be as yours.
There's Gertrude and Brunhilde who can help you with the chores
And there's young Laina who upon a former maid I sired.
And I bed one down each night so you need not get too tired.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c2">
      <lines>
Cuz I'm a man,
Viking man,
And what's worse,
I think I'm in love.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>
Yes I'm a sturdy Viking lad, a fine catch to be sure.
Though I smell much like an ox, my heart is Viking pure.
I thank Odin, I thank Frey, for smiling on my life,
For on, for us, this lucky day you shall become my wife.
