    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>
Westering home with a song in the air
Light of me eye and it's goodbye to care
Laughter and love are a welcoming there
Pride of me heart my own love
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
Tell me a tale of the Orient gay
Tell me of riches that come from Cathay
Ah but it's grand to be waken at day
And find oneself nearer to Isla
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
Where are the folks like the folks of the west
Canty and couthy and kindly, our best
There I would hie me and there I would rest
At hame wi' my ain folks in Isla
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
Now I'm at home and at home I do lay
Dreaming of riches that come from Cathay
I'll hop a good ship and be on my way
And bring back my fortune to Isla
</lines>
