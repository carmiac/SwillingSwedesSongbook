    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
Ye Mariners all as ye pass by
Come in and drink if you are dry
Come spend my lads your money brisk
And pop your nose in a jug of this
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
Oh Mariners all as ye part the ground
You're welcome all for to sit down
Come spend my lads your money brisk
And pop your nose in a jug of this
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
Oh Tipplers all as you pass by
Come in and drink if you are dry
Come in and drink, think not amiss
And pop your nose in a jug of this
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
And now I'm old and can scarcely crawl
I've a long grey beard and a head that's bald
From my desire, fulfill my bliss
A pretty girl, and a jug of this
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>
And when I'm in my grave and dead
And all my sorrows have past and fled
Transform me then into a fish
And let me swim in a jug of this
</lines>
    </verse>
