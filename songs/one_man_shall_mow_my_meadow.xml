One man shall mow my meadow
Two men shall gather it together
Two men and one more
Shall shear my lambs and ewes and rams
And gather my gold together

Four men shall gather it together
Four men, three men, two men and one more
Shall shear my lambs and ewes and rams
And gather my gold together

Shall shear my lambs and ewes and rams
And gather my gold together

Eight men shall gather it together
Eight men, seven men, six men, five men, four men, three men,

Shall shear my lambs and ewes and rams
And gather my gold together
