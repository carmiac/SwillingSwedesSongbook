      <lines>
Let the winds blow high, let the winds blow low
Through the street in me kilt I go
All the lassies say hello
Donald where's yuir trowsers?
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
I just came down from the Isle of Skye
I'm no very big, and I'm awfully shy
The lassies say as I go by
Donald where's yuir trowsers?
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
A lassie took me to a ball
And it was slippery in the hall
And I feared that I might fall
Cause I had on me trowsers!
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
Now I went down to London town
To have some fun on the underground
The lassies turned their heads around
Said, Donald where's yuir trowsers?
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
Ah wearin' the kilt is mighty light
It is not wrong I know it's right
The islanders would get a fright
If they saw me in my trowsers
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>
The lassies love me every one
They have to catch me if they can
They can't take the breeks off a Heilan' man
Sayin' Donald where's yuir trowsers?
</lines>
    </verse>
