    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
When Langbrow first was made the king,
Proclaimed by all his men,
He took to him a goodly wife
Whose name was Whitsom Jen.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
He took to him a goodly wife,
Her name it was sweet Jen
And light her hair, and long her limb,
And Langbrow was her man,
And Langbrow was her man.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
When Langbrow first was made the king,
Proclaimed by all his peers,
He opened up the prison gates
That had been closed for years.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
He opened up the prison gates
With just one little key
And all the men condemned within
Straightways were all set free
Straightways were all set free.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>
When Langbrow first was made the king,
He killed the callous crew
That tortured many a fine woman
And slaughtered not a few.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>
That tortured many a fine woman
And brought them many a shame
Till Langbrow came to rescue them
Returning their good name,
Returning their good name.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v7">
      <lines>
When Langbrow first was made the king,
The country did rejoice
And sang the praises of the king
With cup and wine and voice.
We sang the praises of the king
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v8">
      <lines>
And of his Whitsom Jen
And of the men who followed him,
And also the women,
And also the women!
</lines>
