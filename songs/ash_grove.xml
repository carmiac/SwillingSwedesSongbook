    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
Down yonder green valley where streamlets meander,
When twilight is fading I pensively rove,
Or at the bright noontide in solitude wander
Amid the dark shades of the lonely ash grove.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
'Tis there where the blackbird is cheerfully singing
Each warbler enchants with his note from the tree
Ah, then little think I of sorrow or sadness
The ash grove enchanting, spells beauty for me.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
The ash grove, how graceful, how plainly 'tis speaking
The harp through it playing has language for me
Whenever the light through its branches is breaking
A host of kind faces is gazing on me;
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
The friends of my childhood again are before me
Each step wakes a memory as freely I roam;
With soft whispers laden its leaves rustle o'er me,
The ash grove, the ash grove, alone is my home.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>
My laughter is over, my step loses lightness,
Old countryside measures fall soft on my ear.
Whenever I think on the past and its brightness,
The dear ones I mourn for again gather here.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>
From out of the shadows their loving looks greet me.
And wistfully searching the leafy green dome,
I find other faces, fond, bending to greet me.
The ash grove, the ash grove, alone is my home.
</lines>
