    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
As I came o'er the Cairney Mount
An' doon anang the bloomin' heather
The Heilan' laddie drew his dirk
And sheathed it in my wanton leather
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>
Oh my bonnie Heilan' laddie
Ma handsome bonnie Heilan' laddie
When I'm sick an like tae dee
He'll row me in his tartan plaidee
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
Wi me he played his warlike pranks
An on me boldly did adventure
He did attack me on baith flanks
an pushed me firecely in the center
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
A furious ficht we did maintain
Wi equal courage an desire
Although he charged me three tae one
I stood ma ground an took his fire
</lines>
    </verse>
