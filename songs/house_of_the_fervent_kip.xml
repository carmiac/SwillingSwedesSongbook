    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
There is a house in al-Barran,
They call the Fervent Kip
Has been the ruin of many young lords
That's where I made my slip
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
My father was an English Knight
My mom a maid of France
And had they but taught me a few facts of life
I might have had a chance
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
I wandered far from home one night
When I was just a kid
I stopped and asked them to show me the way
And that's just what they did
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
I left my home an honest lad
My innocence assured
When I returned the following morn'
My weakness had been cured
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>
I've studied long with sages wise
And scholars most astute
But they've taught me less than that single night
In a house of ill repute
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>
There is a house in al-Barran
It's called the Fervent Kip
Has been the ruin of many young lords
That's where I made my slip
</lines>
