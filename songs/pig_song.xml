    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
It was early last December, as near as I remember
Oh I staggered down the street and tipsy cried
No one I was disturbing, as I lay down by the curbing
And then a pig came up and lay down by my side
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
As I lay there by the gutter, thinking thoughts I cannot ...Utter
A Lady passing by was heard to say...

*Hmmmmm. Well, well, well*

You can tell a man who boozes, by the company he chooses
And then the pig got up and slowly walked away
