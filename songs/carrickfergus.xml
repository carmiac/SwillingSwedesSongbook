    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
I wish I was in Carrickfergus,
Only for nights in Ballygran
I would swim over the deepest ocean,
Only for nights in Ballygran,
But the sea is wide and I cannot cross over
And neither have I the wings to fly
I wish I could meet a handsome boatsman
To ferry me over, my love to find
</lines>

    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
My childhood days bring back sad reflections
Of happy times I spent so long ago,
My boyhood friends and my own relations
Have all passed on now like melting snow.
But I'll spend my days in endless roaming,
Soft is the grass, my bed is free.
Ah, to be back now in Carrickfergus,
On that long road down to the sea.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
But in Kilkenny, it is reported,
On marble stones they're as black as ink
With gold and silver I would support her,
But I'll sing no more 'till I get a drink.
For I'm drunk today, and I'm seldom sober,
A handsome rover from town to town,
Ah, but I'm sick now, my days are numbered,
Come all you young men and lay me down.
