    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
And the fog clings wetly to pavilion tops
I packed my flagon in my tourney dragon
when I hit some Misties, I just had to stop.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>
Now I'm glad to say that I'm on my way
won't be back for many a day
They're a bunch of snots and they think they're hot
They're a pack of Misties and I'm glad I'm not!
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
The Misty women all think they're fine
but there ain't enough cheese to go with that whine!
Their days are long and their knights won't play
and so they're all headed up Cynagua way!
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c2">
      <lines>
And I'm sorry to say that they're on their way
lock up your lords and throw the key away
'cause it's hard to keep warm in a pelican storm
and the laurels in the bushes are a rabid swarm!
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
The heralds say we should come out and play
but the Misties all sleep until about midday.
They say they party hard, but they're all tubs of lard
and when they see Cynaguans they just run away!
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c3">
      <lines>
And I'm glad to say that they run away
make it so easy to win the day
We just fight for an hour then hit the shower
I'm proud to be Cynaguan and here I'll stay!
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
In Cynagua town the sun shines down
and the fruits are on the trees where they belong
We have lots of fun making awful puns
and they don't kill the bards when they sing this song!
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c4">
      <lines>
Well I'm glad to say that I'm here to stay
won't have to leave for many a day
'cause all the tourneys are here and we make great beer
and if I don't move west I'll never be a peer!
</lines>
