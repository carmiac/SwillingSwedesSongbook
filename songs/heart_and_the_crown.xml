    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
They rode into town
On the thirteenth of Spring.
She have him her hand
And he gave her his ring.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>
She gave him her heart
And he gave her his crown,
But they never, no never
Went down derry down derry down.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
Her horse was pure white
And his horse was gray
She wanted to go
But he asked her to stay.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
Her eyes were pure black
And his eyes were so blue.
She wanted him strong
And he wanted her true.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
Come all ye fair maidens,
And listen to me,
If you want your young man
To be strong and free
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c2">
      <lines>
Just give him your heart
And he'll give you his crown
Just as long as you never
Go down derry down derry down.
</lines>
