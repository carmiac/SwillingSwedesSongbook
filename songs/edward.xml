    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
What's that blood on your sword Edward?
It is the blood of my greyhound
Your greyhound's blood was never that red Edward
You're telling lies, you're telling lies
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>
And the sun will never shine Edward
And the moon has lost it's light
And the sun will never shine Edward
You're telling lies, you're telling lies
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
What's that blood upon your sword Edward?
It is the blood of my grey mare
Your grey mare's blood was never that grey Edward
You're telling lies, you're telling lies
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
What's that blood upon your sword Edward?
It is the blood of my grey hawk
Your grey hawk's blood was never that grey Edward
You're telling lies you're telling lies
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
What's that blood on your sword Edward?
It is the blood of my brother
Why did you kill your own brother Edward?
For telling lies, for telling lies
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>
What will you do, where will you go Edward?
What will you do, how will you die?
I'll sail away, I'll sail away Mother
And you'll never see more of me
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>
What of your wife, what of your son, Edward?
And what will you leave your mother dear?
The curse of Hell to burn her with Mother
For telling lies, for telling lies
</lines>
    </verse>
