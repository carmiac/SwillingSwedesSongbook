Hey it's Estrella
Let's build a medieval City
It's another year away
But the sunsets are so pretty
Things to do
Filled with friends both old and new
Stardust for you

Search your heart start reminiscin'
Close your eyes
Listen to the drums, the beat will rise

Hey it's Estrella
I've got artworks to display
If every cotehardie I made for you
Would take your breath away

A thousand miles seems pretty far
But Joel the Brewer brought his bar
We'll stumble home until we find the way
Our friends would all make fun of us
And we'll just laugh along because we know
That all of them have felt this way
Estrella I can promise you
When we finally get to you
Your heart will never ever be the same
You're all to blame
</lines>

Goodbye Estrella
You be good and don't you miss me
One more year and we'll be back to you
And we'll recreating history like we do
You'll know it's all because of you
We can do whatever we want to
Hey there Estrella here's to you
This one's for you
