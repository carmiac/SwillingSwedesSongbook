    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
The champion he is brave
and the champion he is bold.
He fights for the lady's honor
and never for the gold.
He asks not the lady for her hand,
for he could not be so bold.
That's not the way of the champion
or so I've been told.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
The champion fights for the lady,
for that's his only way.
He asks not for the lady's love,
just that she will smile that way.
But deep inside his lonely heart
he prays on day by day,
that the lady loves him as he loves she
and bids the champion stay.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
But the champion knows as he turns to grey
there'll be a younger man,
who will enter in the lady's life
and ask her for her hand.
She'll ask the champion, &quot;My friend,
would you mind if I wed this man?&quot;
he'll avert his eyes and say &quot;your happiness
is all I can demand.&quot;
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
So the champion stands off to the side
he never says a word,
and though he loves the lady so
his heart is never heard.
So the champion resigns himself
to a love which can't be cured
as the lady takes herself a lord,
the champion's eyes are blurred.
