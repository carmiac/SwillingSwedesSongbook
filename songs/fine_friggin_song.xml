    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
I went out to take a friggin' walk by the friggin' pier
a-wishin' for a friggin' coin to buy a friggin' beer
my head it was a-achin' and my throat was parched and dry
and so I sent a little prayer a-wingin' to the sky
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
And there came a friggin' falcon and he walked upon the waves
and I said &quot;A friggin miracle&quot; and sang a couple staves
of a friggin churchy ballad I learned when I was young,
The friggin' bird took to the air and spattered me with dung
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
I fell upon my friggin knees and bowed my friggin head,
and said three friggin Aves for all my friggin dead
and then I got upon my feet and said another ten
the friggin' bird burst into flame - and spattered me again
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
The Burnin' bird hung in the sky just like a friggin sun
It seared my friggin eyelids shut and when the job was done
The bird fell from the sky and vanished in the sea so green,
I went to find the friggin' priest to tell him what I'd seen.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>
I told him of the miracle he told me of the Rose
I showed him bird crap in my hair the bastard held his nose
I went to see the bishop but the friggin bishop said,
go home and sleep it off, you sod, and wash yer friggin' head!
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>
Then I came upon a friggin wake for a friggin' rotten swine,
by the name of Jack MacGregor and I touched his head with mine,
And old Jack sat up in his box and raised his friggin head
His wife took out a fryin' pan and beat the bastard dead
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v7">
      <lines>
And I touched his head with mine, and brought him back to life
His smiling face rolled on the floor, this time she used a knife
and then she fell upon her knees and started in to pray
&quot;It's forty years, O Lord&quot; she said &quot; I've waited for this day!&quot;
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v8">
      <lines>
So I walked the friggin' city 'mongst the friggin halt and lame
and every time I raised 'em up, they got knocked down again
'cause the love of God comes down to man in a friggin curious way
But when a man is marked for love, that love is here to stay
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v9">
      <lines>
And this I know because I've got a friggin curious sign
for every time I wash my head the water turns to wine!
and I give it free to workin' lads to brighten up their lives,
so they don't kick no dogs around nor beat up on their wives
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v10">
      <lines>
'Cause there ain't no use to miracles like walkin' on the sea,
They crucified the Son of God, but they don't muck with me!
'Cause I leave the friggin blind alone, the dyin' and the dead,
but every day at four o'clock I wash me friggin head!
</lines>
