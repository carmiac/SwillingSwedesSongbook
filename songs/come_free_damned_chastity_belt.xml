    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>
Come free, damned chastity belt
Keepin' me from where I wanna go
Come free, damned chastity belt
Quick before her husband comes home
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
I gazed at her body, an' what did I see
Keepin me from where I wanna be
That cruel contraption lookin' back at me
Where did he hide that key!
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
I searched high and low for that damned key
Where in the hell could it be?
I've got a hard on stiff as a tree
I've got to get that damned thing free!!
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
I looked out the window and over the lea
Past the cliff out leagues three
Her husbands vessel comin' in from sea
Pretty soon I'll have to flee
</lines>
