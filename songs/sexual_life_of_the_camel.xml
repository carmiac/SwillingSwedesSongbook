    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
The sexual life of the Camel
Is stranger than anyone thinks
One night in a moment of passion
He tried to deflower the Sphinx!
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
Now, the Sphinx's posterior anatomy
Is covered with sand from the Nile.
That accounts for the hump in the Camel,
And the Sphinx's inscrutable smile!
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
The One skin lies over the Two skin
The Two skin lies over the Three
The Three skin lies over the Foreskin
Please roll back my Foreskin for me
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>
Roll back, roll back,
Roll back my Foreskin for me, for me!,
Roll back, roll back,
Roll back my Foreskin for me!
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
The Baron, he rides on a warhorse,
With a fancy great helluva rig,
He doesn't get there any faster,
But it makes the old bastard feel big!
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>
The King, he sleeps in a feather bed
The Knights all sleep in their sacks;
As a means of self-preservation,
The squires all sleep on their backs!
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>
And here's to the girls of St Golias
And here's to the alleys they roam,
And here's to their dirty-faced bastards,
God bless 'em, they may be your own!
</lines>
    </verse>
