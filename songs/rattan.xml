  <lyrics>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
Rattan is wondrous
Use it for tent poles
Make a pavilion
Like they do in the East.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
Fighters just love it
Make weapons from it
Would probably marry
A Rattan Queen.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>
That Rattan
Tape it, don't waste it.
Rattan!
Don't cha just love Rattan?
Rattan!
Rattan!
(Bum dum dum dum dum)
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
Soaking is bad
Don't laminate either
Unless you would like to
Hear Marshals scream
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
Tape is the preference
Mark out the edges
Make it look wooden
Make it look real.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>
Word in the mundane
Rattan is furniture
See just how limited
The real world can be.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>
Hear in the ages
We use it for all things
We use it oh so ho
Creatively.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v7">
      <lines>
I know a fighter
Comes from (random kingdom name)
Didn't wear his
Cup in fight.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v8">
      <lines>
Now he is using
Rattan in a new way
His lady just loves it
Fits like a dream.
</lines>
