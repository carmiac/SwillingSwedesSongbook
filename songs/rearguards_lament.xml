    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
Would there were someone
To bring me cool water
Sweet Adam's ale,
From the ford near to hand.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
Would there a priest
Who could pray me to Heaven
And tell me milady
Is safely away.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>
Fly Lady fly
To Castle Caernarvon
Where the Welsh archers bide
And thy kin still be strong
Fly Lady fly
For the storm's close upon ye
Think well of the laddie
Whose life bought ye time
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
My faithful war stallion
Stands o'er me protective
To keep away ravens
And Saracen thieves
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
No more to go hunting
Or charge into battle
The service he renders
The last that I need
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>
Would there were someone
To bring me cool water
Sweet Adam's ale,
From the ford near to hand.
