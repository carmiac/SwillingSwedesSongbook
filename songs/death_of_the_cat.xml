    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
The trees were growing high
And the wind was in the west
When a hunter aimed his arrow
Into the Cat's broad chest.
And she died, she died.
Against her lover's breast
And we laid her in the earth
So long and narrow.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
It was early, so early
In the graying of the morn,
When we sang of the days
Before the Cat was born.
And how from her mother
She was so shiftily torn,
As we laid her in the earth
So long and narrow.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
Come all ye young fighting men
And listen unto me.
Do not place you affections
Upon a girl so free.
For she'll take the mortal wound
Another meant for thee,
And you'll lay her in the earth
So long and narrow.
