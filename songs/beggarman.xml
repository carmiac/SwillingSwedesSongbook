    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
Well, I am a little beggarman an' beggin' I have been
Threescore years and more in this little Isle of Green
I'm known from the Liffey way down to Killaloe
And the name that I'm known by is Old Johnny Dhu
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>
Of all the trades an' callin's, sure, beggin' is the best
For when a man is weary, he can aye sit down an' rest
He can beg for his dinner, he has nothin' else to do
Only toddle around the corner with his old rigadoo
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
Well, I slept in a barn way down by Killavone
On a dark and stormy night and sleepin' all alone
With holes in the roof and the rain a-comin' through
And the rats and the mice they were playin' peek-a-boo
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
O, then, who did waken but the woman of the house
With her white spotty apron and her calico blouse
She began to cry and when I said: Boo
O, now, don't you be afraid o' me, it's only Johnny Dhu
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
Well, I met a little flaxen-haired girl the other day
Good morning to you, flaxen-haired girl, I did say
Good morning, Johnny Beggarman, there's how do ye do?
With your rags and your bags and your old rigadoo
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>
Well, I'll buy ye a pair o' trousers, a collar and a tie
And a nice little lassie then I'll fetch her by an' by
I'll buy a pair of goggles, and I'll paint them up so blue
And that nice little lassie, I'll be her lover, too
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>
Well, it's over the road, wi' me bag upon me back
It's over the fields wi' me big haver-sack
With holes in me shoes and me toes peepin' through
Singing: Tithery-ump-a-daddy, sure, I'm old Johnny Dhu
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v7">
      <lines>
So now my song is ended and I'll bid you's all good night
The fires are all raked and it's out with the light
And now you've heard the story of the old rigadoo
It's good luck and God be wid you's and to old Johnny, too
</lines>
