    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
In a mean abode on the Skankill Road
Lived a man named William Bloat;
He had a wife, the curse of his life,
Who continually got his goat.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
So one day at dawn, with her nightdress on
He cut her bloody throat.
With a razor gash he settled her hash
Oh never was crime so quick
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
But the drip drip drip on the pillowslip'
Of her lifeblood made him sick.
And the pool of gore on the bedroom floor
Grew clotted and cold and thick.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
Now he was glad he had done what he had
When she lay there stiff and still
But a sudden awe of the angry law
Struck his heart with an icy chill.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>
So to finish the fun so well begun
He decided himself to kill.
He took the sheet from his wife's coul' feet
And twisted it into a rope
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>
And he hanged himself from the pantry shelf,
'Twas an easy end, let's hope.
In the face of death with his latest breath
He solemnly cursed the Pope.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v7">
      <lines>
But the strangest turn to the whole concern
Is only just beginning.
He went to Hell but his wife got well
And she's still alive and sinning
For the razor blade was English made
But the sheet was Belfast linen.
</lines>
    </verse>
