    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
Livin on poundcake, watchin' the sun bake
All of those fighters covered in armor
Beatin' my baudraun, by the pavilion
Smell of the steaks out there on the fire
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>
Wastin' away again in St Golias
Lookin' for my lost bottle of scotch
And some people claim, that there's a woman to blame
But I know, It's nobody's fault
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
Don't know the reason, I came to this e-vent
Nothin for sure but this black an' blue bruise
But it's a real beauty, an armor bite doozy
How it got here I haven't a clue
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c2">
      <lines>
Wastin' away again in St Golias
Lookin' for my lost bottle of scotch
And some people claim, that there's a woman to blame
But I think, Hell it could be my fault
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
Stepped in a chuck hole, blew out a buckle
Tore up my leg, had to cruise on back home
But there's beer in the cooler, though it could be cooler
That golden liquid that helps me hang on
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c3">
      <lines>
Wastin' away again in St Golias
Lookin' for my lost bottle of scotch
An' some people claim that there's a woman to blame
But I know, It's my own damn fault
Yes and some people claim that there's a woman to blame
But I'm glad, It's my own damn fault
</lines>
