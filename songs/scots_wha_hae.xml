    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
Scots, wha hae wi' Wallace bled,
Scots, wham Bruce has often led,
Welcome to your gory bed,
Or to victory.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
Now's the day, and now's the hour;
See the front o' battle lour;
See approach proud Edward's power,
Chains and slavery.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
Wha would be a traitor-knave?
Wha can fill a coward's grave?
Wha sae base as be a slave?
Let him turn and fly:
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
Wha for Scotland's king and law,
Freedom's sword will strongly draw,
Free-man stand, or free-man fa',
Let him follow me.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>
By oppression's woes and pains!
By your sons in servile chains!
We will drain our dearest veins,
But they shall be free!
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>
Lay the proud usurpers low!
Tyrants fall in every foe!
Liberty's in every blow!
Let us do - or die!!!
</lines>
