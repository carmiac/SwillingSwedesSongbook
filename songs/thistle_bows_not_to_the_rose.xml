    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
Ken ye the hearts of the folk of the plaid?
or wonder, as many of what they are made?
They'll be hard as the Highlands, and cold as Loch Moi;
The Scots hae a spirit ye nae can destroy
Oh, born in the damp winds, and raised in the hills,
Those who reach manhood have iron-like wills.
By the reavers and the rovers and the brigands it's known
A Scotsman looks after his Clan and his own.

    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>
So hey for the Highlands, hallo for the low;
Leave a Scot breathin', he'll strike the last blow.
As the Chieftain of England so angrily knows,
The Thistle bows not to the Rose!
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
Oh, the French ladies charm with their glances and sighs,
But give me a lassie with fire in her eyes.
Scots' girls are fiery, they're long and they're lean,
And sharper of wit than a dirk it is keen.
But lovin' the women's like jugglin' with knives;
Too many at once, and men look to your lives;
Yet, find ye but one girl and stay to her true
She'll fight at your back and share in all you do.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
Now some say we're vicious, and heartless and cruel,
But a Scot's a survivor, and nobody's fool.
We've weathered the ages, and the wages of strife,
Betimes it takes hard men to lead a hard life.
So pipe till the blood sings and drink liquid fire;
Watch where you tread, lest you risk Scottish ire;
And mark ye the words of the Mackintosh Clan....
&quot;Touch not the cat --- without a gloved hand!&quot;
