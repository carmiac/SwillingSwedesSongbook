And who are you, me pretty fair maid
And who are you, me honey?
And who are you, me pretty fair maid
And who are you, me honey?
She answered me quite modestly, "I am me mother's darling."

Fol-de-diddle-day

And will you come to me mother's house,
When the sun is shining clearly?
And will you come to me mother's house,
When the sun is shining clearly?
I'll open the door and I'll let you in
And divil 'o one would hear us.

So I went to her house in the middle of the night,
When the moon was shining clearly.
So I went to her house in the middle of the night,
When the moon was shining clearly.
She opened the door and she let me in
And divil the one did hear us.

She took me horse by the bridle and the bit,
And she led him to the stable.
She took me horse by the bridle and the bit,
And she led him to the stable.
Saying "There's plenty of oats for a soldier's horse,
To eat it if he's able."

    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>
Then she took me by the lily-white hand,
And she led me to the table.
Then she took me by the lily-white hand,
And she led me to the table.
Saying "There's plenty of wine for a soldier boy,
To drink it if you're able."

      <lines>
Then I got up and made the bed,
And I made it nice and aisy,
Then I got up and made the bed,
And I made it nice and aisy,
Then I got up and laid her down
Saying "Lassie, are you able?"
</lines>

    <verse name="v7">
      <lines>
And there we lay till the break of day,
And divil a one did hear us.
And there we lay till the break of day,
And divil a one did hear us.
Then I arose and put on me clothes
Saying "Lassie, I must leave you."

    <verse name="v8">
      <lines>
And when will you return again?
And when will we get married?
And when will you return again?
And when will we get married?
When broken shells make Christmas bells
We might well get married.
