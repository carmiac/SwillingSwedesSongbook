We had some chickens, no eggs would they lay
We had some chickens, no eggs would they lay
My wife said, &quot;honey, we're losin' money
Because our chickens, no eggs will they lay.&quot;
One day a rooster flew into the yard
And caught those chickens right off their guard.
They're laying eggs now, just like they used to,
Ever since that rooster, flew into our yard.

We had a hounddog, no pups would she give,
We had a hounddog, no pups would she give.
My wife said, &quot;Honey, we're losing money
Because our hounddog, no pups will she give.&quot;
One day a rooster (that same old rooster) crept into our yard,
And caught that dog right off her guard.
She's giving birddogs just like she used to
Ever since that rooster crept into our yard.

We had a milkcow, no milk would she give.
We had a milkcow, no milk would she give.
My wife said, &quot;Honey, we're losing money
Because our milkcow, no milk will she give.&quot;
Then one day that rooster crept into our yard,
And caught that milkcow right off her guard.
She's giving eggnog, just like she used to,
Ever since that rooster crept into our yard.

We had a gumtree, no gum would it give,
We had a gumtree, no gum would it give.
My wife said &quot;Honey, we're losing money,
Because that gumtree, no gum will it give.&quot;
Then one day that rooster crept into our yard,
And caught that gumtree right off its guard.
It's giving chicklets, just like it used to,
Ever since that rooster crept into our yard.

We had an elephant and no tusks would he grow
We had a elephant and no tusks would he grow
My wife said &quot;Honey, we're losing money,
Because that elephant no tusks would he grow.&quot;
Then one day that rooster crept into our yard,
And caught that elephant right off his guard
He's laying eggs now out of solid ivory
Since that rooster came into our yard
