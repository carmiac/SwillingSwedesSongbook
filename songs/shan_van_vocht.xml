&quot;Oh' the French are on the say,&quot;
says the Shan Van Vocht,
&quot;Oh' the French are on the say,&quot;
Says the Shan Van Vocht.
&quot;Oh! The French are in the bay
They'll be here at break of day,
and the orange will decay.&quot;
Says the Shan Van Vocht,
&quot;And the orange will decay,&quot;
Says the Shan Van Vocht.

&quot;And where will they have their camp?&quot;
Says the Shan Van Vocht;
&quot;And where will they have their camp?&quot;
Says the Shan Van Vocht;
&quot;On the Curragh of Kildare,
And the boys will all be there,
With their pikes in good repair,&quot;

Where our fathers' homes have been
But our own immortal green,&quot;

&quot;Will old Ireland then be free?&quot;

From the centre to the sea
Then hurrah for liberty!&quot;
Says the Shan Van Vocht;
&quot;Then hurrah for liberty!&quot;
Says the Shan Van Vocht.
