    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
How often haunting the highest hilltop
I scan the ocean, a sail to see
Will it come tonight, love, will it come tomorrow
Will it ever come, love, to comfort me
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
Fear-a-uata, no horoway-la
Fear-a-uata, no horoway-la
Fear-a-uata, no horoway-la
O fare thee well, love, where 'er thee be
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
They call thee fickle, they call thee false one
And seek to change me but all in vain
For thou art my dream yet through the dark night
And every morning I watch the main
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
There's not a hamlet, too well I know it,
Where you go wandering or stay awhile
But all its old folk you win with talking
And charm its maidens with song and smile
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>
Dost thou remember the promise made me,
The Tartan plaid, a silken gown
That ring of gold with thy hair and portrait
That gown and ring I will never own!
</lines>
