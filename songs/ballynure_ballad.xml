    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
As I was goin' to Ballynure,
The day I will remember,
For to view the lads and lasses on
The fifth day of November,
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>
With a ma-ring-doo-a-day,
With a ma-ring-a-doo-a-daddy oh!
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
As I was goin' along the road
When homeward I was walking.
I hear a wee lad behind a ditch-a
To his wee lass was talking,
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
Said the wee lad to the wee lass,
&quot;Oh will ye let me kiss ye,
For it's I have got the cordial eye
That far exceeds the whiskey.&quot;
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
This cordial that ye talk about
There's very few o' them gets it,
For there's nothin' now but crooked combs
And muslin gowns can catch it.
</lines>
