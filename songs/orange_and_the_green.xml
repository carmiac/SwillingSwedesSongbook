    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>
Oh it was the biggest mix-up that you have ever seen
My Father he was Orange, and me Mother she was Green
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
Oh my father was an Ulsterman, proud Protestant was he
My mother was a Catholic girl, from County Cork came she
They were married in two churches, lived happily enough
Until the day that I was born, Then things got rather tough
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
Baptized by Father Iley, I was rushed away by car
To be made a little Orangeman, me fathers shinin' star
And I was christened David Anthony, but still in spite of that
To my father I was William, while my mother called me Pat
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
With mother every Sunday to Mass I'd proudly stroll
Then after that the Orange Lords would try to save my soul
Though both sides tried to claim me, but I was smart because
I'd play the flute, or play the harps, dependin' where I was
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
One day me Ma's relations came round to visit me
Just ask my fathers kinfolk, we're all sittin' down to tea
We tried to smooth things over, but they began to fight
An' me bein' strictly neutral, I hit everyone in sight
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>
Now my parents never could agree about my childhood school
My learnin' was all done at home that's why I'm such a fool
They've both passed on, God rest 'em, but left me caught between
That awful color problem of the Orange and the Green
</lines>
    </verse>
