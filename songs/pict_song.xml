    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
Rome never heeds where she treads.
Always the heavy hooves fall
On our stomachs, our hearts and our heads.
And Rome never heeds when we bawl.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>
We are the little folk, we.
Too little to love or to hate.
But leave us alone and you'll see
Just how we can drag down the State.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
The sentries pass on, that is all.
And we gather behind them in hordes,
And plot to reconquer the Wall
With only our tongues for our swords.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
We are the worm in the wood,
We are the rot at the root,
We are the taint in the blood,
We are the thorn in the foot!
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
Mistletoe choking an oak,
Rats gnawing cables in two,
Moths making holes in a cloak,
How they must love what they do.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>
Yes, and we little folk too!
We are as busy as they,
Working our works out of view.
But watch, and you'll see them someday.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>
No, indeed we are not strong.
But we know people who are!
And we, we will guide them along
To crush and destroy you in war.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v7">
      <lines>
Yes, we have always been slaves,
And, yes, we will still be their slaves.
But you, you will die of the shame.
And then we will dance on your graves.
</lines>
