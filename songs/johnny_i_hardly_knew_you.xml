    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>
When going the road to sweet Athy,
Haroo, Haroo
When going the road to sweet Athy,
Haroo, Haroo
When going the road to sweet Athy,
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
A stick in me hand, a glass in me eye,
A doleful damsel I heard cry;
Oh Johnny I hardly knew ye!&quot;
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
Where are the legs that used to run?
When first you learned to carry a gun
I fear your dancing days are done
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
Where are the eyes that were so mild?
That looked upon the world and smiled
Why did you leave your wife and child?
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
You haven't an arm, you haven't a leg
You're a boneless, eyeless, chickenless egg
We'll have to put you out with a bowl to beg
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>
We're happy for to see you home
All from the island of Ceylon
So low in the flesh, so high in the bone
</lines>
