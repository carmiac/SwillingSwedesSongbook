    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
''Tis the last rose of summer, left blooming all alone
All her lovely companions are faded and gone.
No flower of her kindred, no rose bud is nigh
To reflect back her blushes and give sigh for sigh.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
I'll not leave thee, thou lone one, to pine on the stem.
Since the lovely are sleeping, go sleep thou with them.
'Thus kindly I scatter thy leaves o'er the bed
Where thy mates of the garden lie scentless and dead.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
So soon may I follow, when friendships decay
And from love's shining circle the gems drop away
When true hearts lie wither'd and fond ones are flown
Oh! who would inhabit this bleak world alone!
</lines>
