    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
Oh when the sun is hot and your head's burning in your helm
And though you fight and fight, neither side can overwhelm
Under the shieldwall, it's the place to be
With my lady beside me, willingly
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>
Under the shieldwall, where it's quiet and dark
Under the shieldwall, like our own private park
Under the shieldwall, we'll be making love
Under the shieldwall, shieldwall
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
Oh its the safest place a fighter can ever be
No weapon reaches there to break our sweet tranquility
Under the shieldwall, out of the sun
With my lady beside me, we'll be having fun
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
So when the sides are joined, and you find yourself in the press
Why don't you join me there and take a break from battle stress
Under the shieldwall, it's the place to be
With my lady beside me, carnally
</lines>
    </verse>
