Four days before 12th Night my son asked of me,

Three days before 12th Night my best friend bade of me,
&quot;I need 5 gates of hell! Before you do the tunic, after you finish the
corset, while you make the banner that is just like the tabard that is
red and yellow parti&quot;

Two days before 12th Night my neighbor asked of me,
&quot;One dagged sleeved hupalon, 2 linen wimples, 5 gates of Hell!, when you
do the tunic, after the corset, when you finish the banner that is just
like the tabard, that is red and yellow parti&quot;
</lines>

On the day of 12th Night my sister bade of me,
&quot;A 4 layer velvet Tudor, after you start the dagged sleeved hupalon, I'll
take over the wimples, almost done on the 5 gates of Hell, forget about
the tunic, but finish up the corset, don't forget the banner that is just
like the tabard that is red and yellow parti&quot;

On the day after 12th Night- there was 1 velvet Tudor, 1 dagged
sleeved hupalon, 2 linen wimples, 5 gates of Hell!, 1 full length tunic,
a steel boned corset, 1 thread bare banner just like the tabard that all
ended up in Gold Key!
