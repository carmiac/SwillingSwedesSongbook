Oh, I'll drink and drink and drink
To Lillie the Pink, the Pink, the Pink
The savior of the human race
She invented, Medicinal Compound
With applications in every case

Now here's a story, a little bit gory
A little bit happy, a little bit sad
Of Lillie the Pink, and her Medicinal Compound
And how it drove her to the bad

And now he's Emperor of Rome

Paddy Klinger, the Opera singer
Could break a glass with his voice to save
Rubbed his tonsils with Medicinal Compound
Now they break glasses o'er his head

Tinny Hammer, had a terrible stammer
He could hardly say a word
And so they gave him Medicinal Compound
And now he's seen and never heard

Uncle Paul, he was very small, he
Was the shortest man in town
Rubbed his body with Medicinal Compound
Now he weighs only half a pound

Lilly died and went to heaven
All the church bells they did ring
She took her Medicinal Compound
Hark the Herald Angels sing
