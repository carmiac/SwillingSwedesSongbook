    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
There was a lord who lived in the north country
He was a man of wealth and fame
He only had one child, a child but only one
And Lady Diamond was her name
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
She did not love a lord, she did not love a king
She loved a kitchen boy and William was his name
And though he brought her joy, he also brought her shame
And he gave his heart to Lady Diamond
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>
And his hair shined like gold said Lady Diamond
And his eyes like crystal stone said Lady Diamond
Bright as the silver moon
Bright as the sun that shines
On Lady Diamond
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
It was a winters night, the Lord could get no rest
To Lady Diamond's room he came
He sat down on the bed just like a wandering ghost
Now Lady Diamond tell me plain
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
Do you Love a lord, he said, or do you love a king?
I love a kitchen boy and William is his name
And better a love that boy then all your well dressed men
I love his heart, said Lady Diamond
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>
Where are all my men, he said, that I pay meat and fee
Go fetch the kitchen boy and bring him here to me
They dragged him from the house and hung him on a tree
And they gave his heart to Lady Diamond
</lines>
    </verse>
