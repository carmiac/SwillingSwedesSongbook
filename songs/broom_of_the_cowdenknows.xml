    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
How blithe was I each morn to see
My love come o'er the hill.
I jumped the stream, and she flew to me,
And met me with good will.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>
Oh, the broom, the bonny, bonny broom,
The broom of the Cowdenknows.
I wish I was in my own homeland,
There with my own true love.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
I worried not for ewes or lambs,
While both our flocks near me lay.
I gathered in our sheep at night,
And she cheered me all the day.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
She tuned her harp, and strummed so sweet,
The birds stood listening by.
E'en the dull cattle stood and gazed,
Charmed by her melody.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
While, thus, we spent our time by turns,
Betwixt our flocks and play,
I envied not the fairest lad,
Though ne'er so rich and gay.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>
She did oblige me every hour,
Could I but faithful be?
She stole my heart, could I refuse,
What e'er she asked of me?
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>
Hard fate that I should banished be,
Gang heavily with morn,
Because I loved the dearest lass,
That ever yet was born.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v7">
      <lines>
Adieu, ye Cowdenknows adieu,
Farewell all pleasures there.
Ye gods restore me to my love
Is all I want or care.
</lines>
