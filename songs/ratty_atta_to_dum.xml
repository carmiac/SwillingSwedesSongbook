As I rode out to Galway City
At the hour of twelve at night
Who should I see but a handsome damsel
Combin' her hair by candlelight
</lines>

Lassie I have gold and silver
Lassie I have houses and lands
Lassie I have ships on the ocean
They'll be all at your command

Ratty atta to dum to dum day

Did you ever see the grass in the mornin'
All bedecked wi' jewels a rare
Ever see a handsome lassie
Diamonds sparklin in her hair

Ever see a copper kettle
Mended wi' an old tin can
Ever see a handsome lassie
Married off to an ugly man
