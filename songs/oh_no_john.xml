    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
On yonder hill there stands a maiden
Who she is I do not know;
I shall court her, for her beauty,
She must answer yes or no,
</lines>

Oh, Oh, no John,
No John, No John, No.

Madam, on thy face is beauty
On thy lips wild roses grow,
Madam, I would be thy lover,
Madam, answer yes or no,
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
Madam, on thy face is beauty,
At thy bosom lilies grow,
In your bedroom there is pleasure,
Shall I view it? Yes or no.

Madam, I will give you jewels
I will make you rich and free;
I will give you silk and satins
Madam, if you lie with me.

    <verse name="v5">

My husband is a Spanish captain,
Went to sea a month ago.
First he kissed me, then he left me,
Bade me always answer "No!"
</lines>

    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>
Madam, may I tie your garter
Just an inch above your knee?
If my hand should slip a little farther,
Would you think it ill of me?
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v7">
      <lines>
My love and I went to bed together,
There we lay till the cocks did crow;
Open your arms my dearest darling,
Open your arms and let me go.
</lines>
