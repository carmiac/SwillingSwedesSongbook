    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
I am an old man, a gray-bearded knight
But I stood with young Harry on Agincourt's field
My arm is still strong and my eye is still bright
And Baron or bandit, to no man I'll yield
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>
I'll hold the line, when darkness is fallin'
I'll hold the line, with courage and steel
I'll hold the line, till the gray dawn is breakin'
And damned if I ever will yield
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
Oh, I hear the whispers of popinjay warriors
Unblooded young men and merchant's third sons
They call me grandfather and laugh at my warnings
But there'll be no laughter when battles begun
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
And now the French army is camped o'er the river
And on the morrow they'll be at the walls
And all the young popinjays come to me cryin'
Oh, what shall we do when the battle is called?
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c2">
      <lines>
You'll hold the line...
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
Oh, I am an old man, a gray-bearded knight
But I stood with young Harry on Agincourt's field
My arm is still strong and my eye is still bright
And baron or bandit, to no man I'll yield
</lines>
    </verse>
