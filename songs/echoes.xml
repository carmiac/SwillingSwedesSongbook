    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
When I was a young lad a shining dream I had
Of sword and lance, of banner and destrier;
Mail-clad, armed with a blade bright and keen,
For honor's sake went we.
And the forest would echo
With the sound of steel on steel.
And so was my sleep filled with chivalrous deeds
In this dream so real.

    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
When I was a young lad a shining dream I had
Of a lady fair, both beauteous and gentle.
Her servant, I, for a look or a smile;
A sign of favor won.
And the chamber would echo
With my lady's words so dear.
And so was my sleep filled with beauty and love
In this dream so clear.

    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
When I was a young lad a shining dream I had
Of merry nobles who hearkened a table
While bards unequaled sang light and gay
Of mighty legend's woe
And the great hall would echo
With laughter, story, and song.
And so was my sleep filled with friendship and joy
In this dream so strong.

    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
I now a young man live what I dreamed then.
I feast a table with merry nobles;
Ladies peerless in beauty and grace
And warriors mailed and strong.
And the hillsides now echo
With the sounds of my boyhood dreams.
My waking hours are filled with delights.
My dream came true it seems.
And the valleys now echo
With the call to join us and see
Still chivalry lives. Still honor is bright
Your dream's realities.
