    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
Cold wind on the harbour and rain on the road
Wet promise of winter brings recourse to coal
There's fire in the blood and a fog on Bras d'Or
The giant will rise with the moon
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
'Twas the same ancient fever in the Isles of the Blest
That our fathers brought with them when they &quot;went West&quot;
It's the blood of the Druids that never will rest
The giant will rise with the moon
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
So crash the glass down! move with the tide!
Young friends and old whiskey are burning inside
Crash the glass down! Fingal will rise
With the moon
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
In inclement weather the people are fey
Three thousand year stories as the night slips away
Remembering Fingal feels not far away
The giant will rise with the moon
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>
The wind's in the north, there be new moon tonight
And we have no circle to dance in it's sight
So light a torch, bring bring the bottle and build the fire bright
The giant will rise with the moon
</lines>
    </verse>
