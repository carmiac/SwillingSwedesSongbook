    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
I thought I heard the old man say
"Leave her, Johnny, leave her
It's a long, hard pull to the next payday
And it's time for us to leave her"
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>
Leave her, Johnny, leave her!
Oh, leave her, Johnny, leave her
For the voyage is done and the winds don't blow
And it's time for us to leave her!
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
Oh, the winds were foul and the work was hard
Leave her, Johnny, leave her!
From the Liverpool dock to the London yard
And it's time for us to leave her
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
Oh, the skipper was bad, but the mate was worse
Leave her, Johnny, leave her
He'd blow you down with a spike and a curse
And it's time for us to leave her
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
It was rotten meat and moldy bread
Leave her, Johnny, leave her!
You'd eat it or you'd starve to death
And it's time for us to leave her
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>
Well it's time for us to say goodbye
Leave her, Johnny, leave her
For now those pumps are all pumped dry
And it's time for us to leave her
</lines>
