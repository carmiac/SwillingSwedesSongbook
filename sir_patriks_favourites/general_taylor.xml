Walk him along, John, Carry him along
Well General Taylor he gained the day
Carry him to his bury'n ground

Walk him along, John, Carry him along
His shroud of the finest silk will be made
Carry him to his bury'n ground

We'll lower him down on a golden chain
Walk him along, John, Carry him along
On every inch we'll carve his name
Carry him to his bury'n ground

Carry him to his bury'n ground

Walk him along, John, Carry him along
Well General Taylor he's long dead and gone
Carry him to his bury'n ground
