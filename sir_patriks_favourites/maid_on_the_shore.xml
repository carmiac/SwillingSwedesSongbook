    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
There is a young maiden who lives all alone
She lives all alone on the shore-o
There's nothin' she can find to comfort her mind
But to roam all alone on the shore shore shore
But to roam all alone on the shore
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
T'was of the young captain who sailed the salt sea
Let the wind blow high blow low
"I will die, I will die" the young captain did cry
If I don't have that maid on the shore shore shore
If I don't have that maid on the shore
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
Well I have lots of silver I have lots of gold
I have lots of costly ware-o
I'll divide I'll divide with my jolly ship's crew
If they row me that maid on the shore shore shore
If they row me that maid on the shore
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
After much persuasion they got her aboard
Let the wind blow high blow low
They replaced her away in his cabin below
Here's adieu to all sorrow and care care care
Here's adieu to all sorrow and care
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>
They replaced her away in his cabin below
Let the wind blow high blow low
She's so pretty and neat she's so sweet and complete
She sung captain and sailors to sleep sleep sleep
She sung captain and sailors to sleep
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>
Then she robbed him o' silver she robbed him o' gold
She robbed him o' costly ware-o
Then took his broadsword instead of an oar
And paddled her way to the shore shore shore
And paddled her way to the shore
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v7">
      <lines>
"Well me men must be crazy me men must be mad
Me men must be deep in despair-o
For to let you away from my cabin so gay
And to paddle your way to the shore shore shore
And to paddle your way to the shore"
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v8">
      <lines>
"Well your men was not crazy your men was not mad
Your men was not deep in despair-o
I deluded your sailors as well as yourself
I'm a maiden again on the shore shore shore
I'm a maiden again on the shore"
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v9">
      <lines>
Well, there is a young maiden she lives all alone
She lives all alone on the shore-o
There's nothin' she can find to comfort her mind
But to roam all alone on the shore shore shore
But to roam all alone on the shore
</lines>
