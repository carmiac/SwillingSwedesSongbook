    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
Come all ye lads, draw near to me
That I be not forsaken
This day was lost the Jeannie C
And my living has been taken
I'll go to sea no more
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
We set out this day in the bright sunrise
The same as any other
My son and I and old John Price
In the boat named for my mother
I'll go to sea no more
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
Now it's well you know what the fishing has been
It's been scarce and hard and cruel
But this day, by God, we sure caught cod
And we sang and we laughed like fools
I'll go to sea no more
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
I'll never know what it was we struck
But strike we did like thunder
John Price give a cry and pitched overside
Now it's forever he's gone under
I'll go to sea no more
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>
Now a leak we've sprung, let there be no delay
If the Jeannie C. we're saving
John Price is drown'd and slip'd away
So I'll patch the hole while you're bailing
I'll go to sea no more
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>
But no leak I found from bow to hold
No rock it was that got her
But what I found made me heart stop cold
For every seam poured water
I'll go to sea no more
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v7">
      <lines>
My God, I cried as she went down
That boat was like no other
My father built her when I was nine
And named her for my mother
I'll go to sea no more
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v8">
      <lines>
And sure I could have another made
In the boat shop down in Dover
But I would not love the keel they laid
Like the one the waves roll over
I'll go to sea no more
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v9">
      <lines>
So come all ye lads, draw near to me
That I be not forsaken
This day was lost the Jeannie C
And my whole life has been taken
I'll go to sea no more
</lines>
