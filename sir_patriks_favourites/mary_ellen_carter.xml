    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
She went down last October in a pouring driving rain
The skipper, he'd been drinking and the Mate, he felt no pain
Too close to Three Mile Rock, and she was dealt her mortal blow
And the Mary Ellen Carter settled low
There was just us five aboard her when she finally was awash
We'd worked like hell to save her, all heedless of the cost
And the groan she gave as she went down, it caused us to proclaim
That the Mary Ellen Carter'd rise again
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
Well, the owners wrote her off; not a nickel would they spend
She gave twenty years of service, boys, then met her sorry end
But insurance paid the loss to us, so let her rest below
Then they laughed at us and said we had to go
But we talked of her all winter, some days around the clock
For she's worth a quarter million, afloat and at the dock
And with every jar that hit the bar, we swore we would remain
And make the Mary Ellen Carter rise again
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>
Rise again, rise again!
Let her name not be lost to the knowledge of men
Those who loved her best and were with her 'til the end
Will make the Mary Ellen Carter rise again!
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
All spring, now, we've been with her on a barge lent by a friend
Three dives a day in hard hat suit and twice I've had the bends
Thank God it's only sixty feet and the currents here are slow
Or I'd never have the strength to go below
But we've patched her rents, stopped her vents, dogged hatch and porthole down
Put cables to her, 'fore and aft and girded her around
Tomorrow, noon, we hit the air and then take up the strain
And make the Mary Ellen Carter rise again
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
For we couldn't leave her there, you see, to crumble into scale
She'd saved our lives so many times, living through the gale
And the laughing, drunken rats who left her to a sorry grave
They won't be laughing in another day
And you, to whom adversity has dealt the final blow
With smiling bastards lying to you everywhere you go
Turn to, and put out all your strength of arm and heart and brain
And like the Mary Ellen Carter, rise again
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c2">
      <lines>
Rise again, rise again!
Though your heart, it be broken, and life about to end
No matter what you've lost, be it a home, a love, a friend
Then like the Mary Ellen Carter, rise again!
Rise again, rise again!
Though your heart, it be broken, or life about to end
No matter what you've lost, be it a home, a love, a friend
Like the Mary Ellen Carter, rise again!
