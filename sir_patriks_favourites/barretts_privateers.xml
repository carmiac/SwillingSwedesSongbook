    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
Oh, the year was 1778,
    ("How I wish I was in Sherbrook now!")
A letter of mark came from the King
To the scummiest vessel I've ever seen.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>
God damn them all!
I was told we'd cruise the seas for American gold
We'd fire no guns, shed no tears.
Now I'm a broken man on a Halifax Peer,
The last of Barrett's Privateers.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
Oh, Elcid Barrett cried the town
    ("How I wish I was in Sherbrook now!")
For twenty brave soul all fisherman who
Would make for him the "Antelope's" crew
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
The "Antelopes" sloop was a sickening sight
    ("How I wish I was in Sherbrook now!")
She had a list to the port and her sails in rags
And the cook in the scuppers with the staggers and jags
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
On the king's birthday we set to sea
    ("How I wish I was in Sherbrook now!")
It was ninety one days to Montigo Bay
Pumping like madmen all the way
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>
On the ninety sixth day we sailed again
    ("How I wish I was in Sherbrook now!")
When a bloody great Yankee hove in sight
With our cracked four-pounders we made to fight.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>
Oh, the Yankee lay low down with gold
    ("How I wish I was in Sherbrook now!")
She was broad and fat and loose in stays
But to catch her took the Antelope two whole days.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v7">
      <lines>
Then at length we stood two cables away
    ("How I wish I was in Sherbrook now!")
Our cracked four-pounders made an awful din
But with one fat ball the Yank stove us in
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v8">
      <lines>
Oh, the Antelope shook and pitched on her side
    ("How I wish I was in Sherbrook now!")
Oh Barrett was smashed like a bowl of eggs
And the Maintruck carried off both me legs.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v9">
      <lines>
So here I sit in my twenty-third year
    ("How I wish I was in Sherbrook now!")
It's been six years since I sailed away
And I just made Halifax yesterday
</lines>
    </verse>
