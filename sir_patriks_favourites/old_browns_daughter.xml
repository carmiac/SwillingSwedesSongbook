    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
There is an ancient party at the other end of town
He keeps a little grocery store, and the ancient's name is Brown
He has a lovely daughter, such a treat I never saw
Oh, I only hope someday to be the old man's son-in-law
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
Old Brown sells from off his shelf most anything you please
He's got juice hops for the little boys, lollipops and cheese
His daughter minds the store and it's a treat to see her serve
I'd like to run away with her but I don't have the nerve
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>
And it's Old Brown's daughter is a proper sort of girl
Old Brown's daughter is as fair as any pearl
I wish I was a Lord, Mayor, Marquis or an Earl
And blow me if I wouldn't marry Old Brown's girl
Blow me if I wouldn't marry Old Brown's girl
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
Well poor Old Brown now has trouble with the gout
He grumbles in his little parlour when he can't get out
And when I make a purchase, Lord, and she hands me the change...
That girl she makes me pulverized, I feel so very strange

    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
Miss Brown, she smiles so sweetly when I say a tender word
Oh, but Old Brown says that she must wed a Marquis or a Lord
And I don't suppose it's ever one of those things I will be...
But, by jingo, next election I will run for Trinity!
