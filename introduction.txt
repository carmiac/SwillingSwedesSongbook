Some of my best memories include singing around the camp fire. This book is dedicated to everyone who has lent their voice while holding a book such as this.\\

Special thanks to:\\
\begin{itemize}
  \item Lady Amiee of Golias, for the original transcription of most of these songs
  \item Lady Auria of Golias, for helpful feedback and cheerleading
  \item Lord Galen McIntyre, for providing several songs
  \item Lady Ismeralda Franceska Rusciolelli DaVale, for providing several songs
  \item Winnifred de Canterbury, for help proofreading and editing 
\end{itemize}
Without all of you this book never would have been possible. \\

This book is not for sale under any circumstances, it can only be given away.\\

I have included credits and copyright information for each song, as far as known to me. If you have updated information please contact me at  \href{mailto:carmiac@gmail.com}{carmiac@gmail.com}\\
