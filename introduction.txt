Some of my best memories include singing around the camp fire. This book is dedicated to everyone who has lent their voice while holding a book such as this.\\

This book is not for sale under any circumstances, it can only be given away.\\

Thanks to Amy for doing so much work in the original transcription of many of these songs, Winnifred de Canterbury for help proofreading and editing, Lady Ismeralda Franceska Rusciolelli DaVale for providing several songs, and Lady Auria for helpful feedback and cheerleading. Without you this never would have been made. \\

I have included credits and copyright information for each song, as far as known to me. If you have updated information please contact me at  \href{mailto:carmiac@gmail.org}{carmiac@gmail.org}\\
