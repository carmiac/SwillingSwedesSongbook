Some of my best memories include singing around the camp fire. This book is dedicated to everyone who has lent their voice while holding a book such as this.\\

This book is not for sale under any circumstances, it can only be given away.\\

Thanks to Amy, Joshua, Kelly, Lauren and Mandy. Without you this never would have been made. \\

I have included credits and copyright information for each song, as far as known to me. If you have updated information please contact me at  \href{mailto:carmiac@gmail.org}{carmiac@gmail.org}\\
