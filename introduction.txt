Some of my best memories include singing around the campfire. This book is dedicated to everyone who has lent their voice while holding a book such as this.\\

This book is not for sale under any circumstances, it can only be given away.\\

I have included credits and copyright information for each song, as far as known to me. If you have updated information please contact me at  \href{mailto:carmiac@gmail.org}{carmiac@gmail.org}\\
