\beginsong{I've Gone Away}
\beginverse
There was a man with an hourglass for keeping the time of day
he would scream it by hour, with all of his power
I was glad when they took him away
for what's in the knowing, if the flowers are growing,
and your troubles locked safely away.
As the moon slowly rises and the day dies behind us,
don't call me I've gone away ... to the S C A.
\endverse
\beginverse
In another life I was a business man
in an office with four telephones,
and I made lots of money, but I felt pretty crummy
in my starched plastic business man's clothes.
But what can that matter, when there's ladies to flatter
and the bards all around to play.
We'll sit by the fire, we'll watch it grow higher.
don't call me I've gone away ... to the S C A.
\endverse
\beginverse
A friend I have said I've lost my mind
that I spend to much time in the past,
I tell him I'm fine, drinking ale and wine
and that he's just a pain in the ass.
Well, out on the field with a sword and a shield
the fighters crash into the frey
It's chivalry's game for honor and fame
and don't call me I've gone away ... to the S C A
\endverse
\beginverse
It seems kind of funny, men spend their lives running
on a quest for a phoney brass ring well,
I've made that money and I can tell ya, honey
that it don't really mean anything.
There's more to this life that the magazines say
than you can see on your tv screen
oh don't call me I've gone away
oh don't call me I've gone away
oh don't call me I've gone away
to the S C A. 
\endverse
