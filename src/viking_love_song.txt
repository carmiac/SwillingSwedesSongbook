\beginverse
Oh I'm a sturdy Viking lad with hairy chest and chin,
to match my furry armor so you can't tell where they end.
I'm hung just like a horse to keep the ladies satisfied.
and now I've come down from the north to hunt me up a bride.
\endverse
\beginverse
I saw you in your father's fields and knew him to be rich.
so I cut his legs off at the knees and tossed him in the ditch.
I plundered all his cattle and took his larder too.
And now I hie me back to Jaul in hopes to marry you.
\endverse
\beginchorus
Cuz I'm a man,
Viking man,
and what's more,
I think I'm in love.
\endchorus
\beginverse
I've lots of wealth to offer and that's truly not a boast.
for I've all the wealth of half the farms along the eastern coast.
I slaughtered all your family just to prove to you my heart,
and by your hair I drug you home so we need not be apart.
\endverse
\beginverse
I've have many servants that will also be as yours.
There's Gertrude and Brunhilde who can help you with the chores
And there's young Laina who upon a former maid I sired.
and I bed one down each night so you need not get too tired.
\endverse
\beginchorus
Cuz I'm a man,
Viking man,
and what's worse,
I think I'm in love.
\endchorus
\beginverse
Yes I'm a sturdy Viking lad, a fine catch to be sure.
Though I smell much like an ox, my heart is Viking pure.
I thank Odin, I thank Frey, for smiling on my life,
for on, for us, this lucky day you shall become my wife.
\endverse
\beginchorus
Cuz I'm a man,
Viking man,
and what's worse,
I think I'm in love.
\endchorus
\beginchorus
Cuz I'm a man,
Viking man,
and what's worse,
I think I'm in love.
