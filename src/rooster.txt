We had some chickens, no eggs would they lay

My wife said, "honey, we're losin' money

And caught those chickens right off their guard.
They're laying eggs now, just like they used to,
Ever since that rooster, flew into our yard.

Ever since that rooster crept into our yard.

Since that rooster came into our yard
