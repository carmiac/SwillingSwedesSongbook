A voice you will hear from below
Saying send down a hogshead of whiskey
To drink with old Rosin the Beau

And stack them all up in a row
Let them drink outta half-gallon bottles
To the memory of Rosin the Beau

And let them all stagger and go
And dig a great hole in the meadow
And in it put Rosin the Beau

Put one at me head and me toe
With a diamond ring scratch upon it
The name of old Rosin the Beau

That cruel remorseless old foe
And I lift up me glass in his honor
Take a drink with old the Rosin the Beau
