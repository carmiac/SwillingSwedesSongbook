\beginsong{Odin}[tune = {Mercedes Benz - Janis Joplin}]
\textnote{Now here's a song of great religious and historical import'.}
\beginverse
O-din won't you bring me a long bastard sword
I've killed 60 Normans, I deserve a reward
My tribe all use pole arms but I'm getting bored
O-din won't you give me a long bastard sword
\endverse
\beginverse
O-din won't you give me a red 12 course lute
When I sing accapella they give me the boot
I really like salad and I'd sing for my curt-ons
O-din won't you give me a red 12 course lute
\endverse
\beginverse
O-din won't you give me a flagon of mead
I'm dry and I'm parched and I'm really in need
Can't face the day sober and I'm all out of weed
O-din won't you give me a flagon of mead
\endverse
\beginverse
O-din won't you give me a warm cuddly Knight
A cold lonely bed always gives me a fright
A Duke on my left and an Earl on my right
O-din won't you give me a warm cuddly Knight 
\endverse
