\beginsong{Lovers Heart}[by={Andy Stewart, Phil Cunningham}]
\beginverse
She was in the flowery garden, when first she caught my eye
And I just a marching soldier; she smiled as I passed by
The flowers she held were fresh an' fair, her lips were full and red
And as I passed that shady bower, she turned to me and said 
\endverse
\beginchorus
Last night we spoke of love
Now we're forced to part
You leave to the sound of a marching drum
And the beat of a lover's heart 
\endchorus
\beginverse
She was by the shore in the evening, when next I saw my dear
Running barefoot by the waterside, she called as I drew near
The sunlight glanced at the waters edge, makin' fire of her auburn hair
My young heart danced at her parting words that hung in the evening air
\endverse
\beginverse
She was on the Strand next morning when orders came to sail
And as we slipped our ropes away I watched her from the rail
She threw me a rose which fell between us, and floated in the bay
And as our ship pulled from the shore, I heard her call and say 
\endverse
\beginverse
Now the soldiers life won't suit me, sweet music is my trade
For I'd rather melt the heardest heart, than pierce it with a blade
Let the time be short 'til I return to my home in the north of Skye
And the loving girl who stole my heart, with these words as I passed by 
\endverse
