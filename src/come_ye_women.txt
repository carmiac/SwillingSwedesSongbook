\beginsong{Come Ye Women}
\beginverse
O come ye women of the isles,
And listen to my song,
For if ye be but thirteen years ye not be women long.
And if ye be three score and ten,
No longer women be,
Or so say all the merry men
Who count so cruelly,
Who count so cruelly.
\endverse
\beginverse
But women we be from our birth
And will be till we die,
Our count is made so differently
To give the men that lie.
O come, ye women of the Isles,
And listen to my song,
For we be women all through life,
Where life and love are long,
Where life and love are long. 
\endverse
