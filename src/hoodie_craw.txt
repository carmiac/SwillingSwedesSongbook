\beginsong{The Hoodie Craw}[by={Traditional}]
\beginverse
The Hoodie Craw has a black, black heart
He's the vilest of the craws
He's a greedy hawk, and an evil scavenger thief wherever he goes
For he picks at the heart and pecks at the corpse
And drinks o' the blood of his prey
It's a grey ill wind in the world o' birds
When the Hoodie blaws their way
\endverse
\beginverse
The sick will fear him hover near
For he smells their failing breath
Where the feeble lie, he'll wait nearby
And attend them at their death
He'll worry the weak wi' a jab o' his beak
He'll frighten young and old
And the wind that blaws the Hoodie in
Has a cheerless bitter cold
\endverse
\beginverse
In the open sky his piercing eye
Will search the grounds below
And the threshing sound of his beating wings
His victims soon will know
No clamor calls nor helpless cries
Distract him from his task
And the whistling wind that sends them in
Has an icy chilly blast
\endverse
\beginverse
The Eagle guards his eyrie
Safe high up in the hills
And the fearless Robin
Braves the cold and damp wet winter chills
But Craws gang up and hound their prey
And send them to their grave
And the prize they crave is the fat and the juice
And the blood of the Ravens Craig
\endverse
\beginverse
The skin is stripped the bones are picked
The carcass dead and gone
And the cries that echo round the skies
Are quiet and forlorn
The rain falls down to heal the scars
And wash them in it's flood
And the Hoodie rides on another wind
In search of other blood
And the Hoodie rides on another wind
In search of other blood
Ravens Craig no more
Ravens Craig no more 
\endverse
