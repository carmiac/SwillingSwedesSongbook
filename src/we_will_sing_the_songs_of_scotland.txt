\beginchorus
We will sing the songs of Scotland
Now that we are gathered here
We will sing the songs of Scotland,
Oh this land we hold so dear
\endchorus
\beginchorus
Of the Hielan's and the Lowlands,
We will sing them all and then
Just because we love them,
We will sing them all again
\endchorus
\beginverse
There are stirring, spirit songs of war
Where we march the gallant man
There are songs of hearth and home
Of the mountain and the glen
\endverse
\beginverse
There are songs of joy to make us glad
And song of sadness too
And sweet the songs of love
And they all belong to you
\endverse
\beginchorus
We will sing the songs of Scotland
Now that we are gathered here
We will sing the songs of Scotland,
Oh this land we hold so dear
\endchorus
\beginchorus
Of the Hielan's and the Lowlands,
We will sing them all and then
Just because we love them,
We will sing them all again
