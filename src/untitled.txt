\beginverse
Our King has called us out to war, and off to war we'll go
To defend our bonny homelands, against some mighty foe
We leave our homes, and our wives, our lovers, and our friends
For now we're marching off to war, our homeland to defend
\endverse
\beginverse
We marched for many miles, the road seemed without end
We walked onto that battlefield, my heart was filled with dread
For to our fifty, they had twice, and then half again
Our allies could not come before that battle did begin
\endverse
\beginverse
Our King, he was no coward, and from the front he led
And when that charge had ended, the battlefield ran red
Full half their number we had killed, but many of us lay slain
And so they made to slaughter us, and leave us on that plain
\endverse
\beginverse
That day upon the battlefield, were glories never told
For many valiant men died there, but dearly our lives were sold
They killed us to a man that day, we would not leave that field
No quarter we could ask for, and we could never yield
\endverse
\beginverse
When that day was over, none of us did stand
They took our homes away from us, our women and our land
But in our songs and stories our traditions will survive
And one day we shall rise again, and once again will thrive
\endverse
\beginverse
Our King has called us out to war, and off to war we go
To defend our bonny homeland, against some mighty foe
We leave our homes and our wives, our lovers and our friends
For now we're marching off to war, our homeland to defend 
\endverse
