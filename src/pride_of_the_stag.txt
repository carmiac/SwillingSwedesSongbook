\beginverse
The Outlands has fought in wars outside our realm,
Traveled far for the sake of the crown,
But oft foreign lands judge us by how we appear,
In spite of the honor we've shown.
\endverse
\beginchorus
For an Outlander's soul is tied strong to our king,
Takes pride in the strength of the stag.
And to those who may view us as less than we are:
Beware the approach of our flag.
\endchorus
\beginverse
Now some kingdoms view us as barbaric men,
Make light of our dress and our ways,
But the drums that they hear beat our dance out tonight,
Will beat out their doom the next day.
\endverse
\beginverse
Now some kingdoms view us as swordsmen for hire,
To be bought for a silver a day,
But the silver does not change an Outlander's pride,
We fight for our glory, not pay.
\endverse
\beginverse
Now some kingdoms view us as nothing to fear,
For deer are not known to be brave,
But when foreign crowns crumple beneath antlers and hooves,
They'll pray to their gods to be saved.
\endverse
