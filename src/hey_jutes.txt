\beginsong{Hey Jutes}[tune = {Hey Jude - The Beatles}]
\beginchorus
Hey Jutes, don't make it bad
Take a Saxon and make him deader
Remember to knock off all of his kin
Then you begin to get better 
\endchorus
\beginchorus
Hey Jutes, don't be afraid
There is Briton go out and get her
The minute the Angles let you in
Then you begin to set the fetters 
\endchorus
\beginverse
And any time you felt the strain, Hey Jutes, refrain
Don't carry the wounded on your shoulders
And well you know that it's a rule, Hey Jutes, be cool
Just wait 'til the weather's a little colder 
Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na 
\endverse
\beginchorus
Hey Jutes, don't let me down
You have found her, now go and wed her 
Remember to put her into your cart
Then you can start to bed her. 
\endchorus
\beginverse
Even though that you're just Danes, Hey Jutes, remain
The country is yours until the Normans come
And don't you know that it's just you, Hey Jutes, you'll do
They're waiting for someone to control them
Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na 
\endverse
\beginchorus
Hey Jutes, don't make it bad
Take a Saxon and make him deader
Remember to flay off all of his skin
Then you begin to get better
Better, better, better, better owwww!
Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na 
\endchorus
