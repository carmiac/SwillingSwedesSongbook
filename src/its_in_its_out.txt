\beginsong{It's In, It's Out}[tune = {Sunrise, Sunset}]
\beginverse
Where is that hero I married?
Where is that lover that I knew?
Once we made merry love for hours, all night through.
\endverse
\beginverse
I don't remember growing older.
Somehow the years have slipped away.
Hormones are raging and I won't wait! 
\endverse
\beginchorus
It's up. It's down;
It's in. it's out.
Then it goes away.
Done is that fellow (phallus) that I played with,
Gone is the romping in the hay. 
\endchorus
\beginverse
Now he's older, growing older;
Still there is no way...
He claims the minutes now are hours,
timing was never his forte!
\endverse
\beginverse
He's through, I'm not;
He's cold, I'm hot,
Sleep would come his way...
Finish the task my lord, I warn thee,
Or there'll be bloody hell to pay. 
\endverse
\beginchorus
It's up. It's down;
It's in. it's out.
Then it goes away.
Done is that fellow (phallus) that I played with,
Gone is the romping in the hay. 
\endchorus
\beginverse
Gently he turns to me and whispers,
Words that do set my soul aflame;
Then with a loving smile he takes me,
Things have changed!
\endverse
\beginverse
Evening is turning into daylight
Some things will never be the same.
Now I am begging him for mercy,
I've been tamed 
\endverse
\beginchorus
No doubt, it's up.
It's in, its out,
And it seems to stay.
Now it's this lady who needs sleep, dear,
Later we'll love again and play. 
\endchorus
