\beginsong{Have You Seen the Army?}[by={Mikal the Ram}]
\beginverse
Have ye heard the story from the land of Calontir?
With sword and axe a-swinging fit to make a grown man fear?
The barons called for taxes, the people answered "Nay!"
"And if you come collecting, there' ll be hell to pay!
\endverse
\beginchorus
Have you seen the army, it was here a while ago,
And do you know who's winning? Have we struck a mortal blow?
I do not know your armor, but you seem a friend to me,
Oh have you seen the army marching in Forgotten Sea?
HMMMMMMMMMMM
\endchorus
\beginverse
You should have seen the battle, 'twas a glory to be seen,
Conveniently the dead were rolled into a deep ravine,
The bandits followed Halidar into a brushy patch,
If it hadn't been poison ivy they'd have won without a scratch!
\endverse
\beginverse
'Twas at the bridge they tell me, that they made their final stand,
But it's hard to win a battle when you're killed by your own man.
The captain of the guardsmen hit upon a plan so bold,
With a trick used every tax-time, hide your sacks of gold!
\endverse
