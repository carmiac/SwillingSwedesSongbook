\beginsong{Song of a Forgotten God }[by={Tawnee~Darkfalcon, Scarhart}]
\beginverse
Where have all my children gone?
It didn't seem I'd slept so long.
All the beauty's gone away;
It was here just yesterday.
\endverse
\beginverse
Butterflies no longer sing,
Faerie bells no longer ring.
Gone the dancers of the mist;
Mortals whom the gods once kissed.
\endverse
\beginverse
No more riders in the sky.
Never more shall dragons fly.
Stranger can you tell me why
All I've ever loved has died?
\endverse
\beginverse
Who are you who walk this land?
Death is happy in your hand.
You pretend that I'm not real,
Not believing what you feel.
\endverse
\beginverse
I'm tempted to strike you down,
Don again my crystal crown;
Take you back to yesterday...
But, instead, I think I'll just go away.... 
\endverse
