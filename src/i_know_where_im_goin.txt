\beginsong{I Know Where I'm goin'}
\beginverse
I know where I'm goin',
And I know who's a goin' with me,
I know who I love
But the dear knows who I'll marry!
\endverse
\beginverse
I have stockings of silk,
Shoes of fine green leather,
Combs to buckle my hair,
And a ring for every finger.
\endverse
\beginverse
Some say he's black,
But I say he's bonny,
The fairest of them all
My handsome, winsome Johnny.
\endverse
\beginverse
Feather beds are soft,
And painted rooms are bonny,
But I would leave them all
To go with my love Johnny.
