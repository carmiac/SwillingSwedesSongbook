It's wonderful to be here,
It's certainly a thrill,
You're such a lovely audience,
Your ransom we'll take home with us,

I don't really want to stop the show,
But we thought you really ought to know,
To escape us, you must pay a fee,
Call it ransom money if you please.

Now may I introduce to you,
The head of our conspiracy,

Pay your FEES!
