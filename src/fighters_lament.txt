\beginsong{The Fighters Lament}[index = {I once had a sword },
                     tune = {Norwegian Wood}]
\beginverse
I once had a sword
Or should I say, it once had me
I just picked it up
Oh what a sword
It was plus three
\endverse
\beginverse
Its ego was twelve
A fact of which I wasn't aware
I tried to leave
And I found that the sword didn't care
Oh, oh, oh
\endverse
\beginverse
I walked through the halls
Wasting my time
Nothing to find
Then I turned around
And then I said
"Oh no, undead"
\endverse
\beginverse
The thirty two knights saw me coming
And started to laugh
I closed my eyes
As my sword started hewing a path
Oh, oh, oh
\endverse
\beginverse
And when I awoke
I was alone
That sword had flown
Now I use a club
Isn't it good
No-Ego wood 
\endverse
