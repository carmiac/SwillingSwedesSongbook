                     tune = {People are Strange - The Doors}]
\textnote{Chorus every two verses}
\beginverse
Rattan is wondrous
Use it for tent poles
Make a pavilion
Like they do in the East. 
\endverse
\beginverse
Fighters just love it
Make weapons from it
Would probably marry
A Rattan Queen. 
\endverse
\beginchorus
That Rattan
Tape it, don't waste it.
Rattan!
Don't cha just love Rattan?
Rattan!
Rattan!
(Bum dum dum dum dum) 
\endchorus
\beginverse
Soaking is bad
Don't laminate either
Unless you would like to
Hear Marshals scream
\endverse
\beginverse
Tape is the preference
Mark out the edges
Make it look wooden
Make it look real.
\endverse
\beginverse
Word in the mundane
Rattan is furniture
See just how limited
The real world can be.
\endverse
\beginverse
Hear in the ages
We use it for all things
We use it oh so ho
Creatively.
\endverse
\beginverse
I know a fighter
Comes from (random kingdom name)
Didn't wear his
Cup in fight.
\endverse
\beginverse
Now he is using
Rattan in a new way
His lady just loves it
Fits like a dream. 
\endverse
