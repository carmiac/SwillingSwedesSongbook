\beginsong{Leprosy}[tune = {Yesterday - The Beatles}]
\beginverse
Leprosy,
All my skin is falling off of me
And it's simple, very plain to see
I've got a case of Leprosy
\endverse
\beginverse
Leprosy,
Friends and family shy away from me
And I can't afford a colony
Oh I am stuck with Leprosy
\endverse
\beginchorus
Why I have to rot, I know not
I cannot say
Gangrene is better but
I am stuck, with Leprosy
\endchorus
\beginverse
Leprosy,
All my clothes are dirty rags you see
That's why all the people stare at me
Oh why do I have Leprosy
\endverse
\beginchorus
Why I have to rot, I know not
I cannot say
Gangrene is better but
I am stuck with Leprosy
\endchorus
\beginverse
Leprosy,
I'm not half the man I used to be
That's 'cause half of me is dead you see
Oh I am plagued with Leprosy 
\endverse
