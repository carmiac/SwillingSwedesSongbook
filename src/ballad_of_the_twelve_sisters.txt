\beginsong{Ballad of the Twelve Sisters}
\beginverse
There were twelve sisters by a lake,
Rosemary, bayberry, thistle and thorn,
\endverse
\beginverse
A handsome sailor one did take,
And that day a child was born.
A handsome sailor one did wed,
Rosemary, bayberry, thistle and thorn,
\endverse
\beginverse
The other sisters wished her dead
On the day the child was born.
"Oh, sister, give me your right hand,"
Rosemary, bayberry, thistle and thorn,
\endverse
\beginverse
Eleven to the one demand
On the day the child was born.
They laid her down upon the hill,
Rosemary, bayberry, thistle and thorn,
\endverse
\beginverse
And took her babe against her will
On the day the child was born.
They left her on the cold hillside,
Rosemary, bayberry, thistle and thorn,
\endverse
\beginverse
Convinced that her new babe had died
On the day the child was born.
She wept red tears, and she wept gray,
Rosemary, bayberry, thistle and thorn,
\endverse
\beginverse
Till she had wept her life away,
On the day her child was born.
The sailor's heart it broke in two,
Rosemary, bayberry, thistle and thorn,
\endverse
\beginverse
The sisters all their act did rue
From the day the child was born.
And from their graves grew rose and briar,
Rosemary, bayberry, thistle and thorn,
\endverse
\beginverse
Twined till they could grow no higher,
From the day the child was born. 
\endverse
