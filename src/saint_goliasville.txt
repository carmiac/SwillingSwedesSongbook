\beginsong{Saint Golias-ville }[tune = {Margaritaville - Jimmy Buffet}]
\beginverse
Livin on poundcake, watchin the sun bake
All of those fighters covered in armor
Beatin' my baudraun, by the pavilion
Smell of the steaks out there on the fire 
\endverse
\beginchorus
Wastin' away again in St Golias
Lookin' for my lost bottle of scotch
And some people claim, that theres a woman to blame
But I know, It's nobody's fault 
\endchorus
\beginverse
Don't know the reason, I came to this e-vent
Nothin for sure but this black an' blue bruise
But it's a real beauty, an armor bite doosey
How it got here I haven't a clue 
\endverse
\beginchorus
Wastin' away again in St Golias
Lookin' for my lost bottle of scotch
And some people claim, that theres a woman to blame
But I think, Hell it could be my fault 
\endchorus
\beginverse
Stepped in a chuck hole, blew out a buckle
Tore up my leg, had to cruise on back home
But theres beer in the cooler, though it could be cooler
That golden liquid that helps me hang on 
\endverse
\beginchorus
Wastin' away again in St Golias
Lookin' for my lost bottle of scotch
An' some people claim that theres a woman to blame
But I know, It's my own damn fault

Yes and some people calim that theres a woman to blame
But I'm glad, It's my own damn fault 
\endchorus
