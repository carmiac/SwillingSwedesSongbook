\beginverse
My lady love please come to me,  
The Newbie Drinkers have gone to sleep  
Though they were loud they have gone away 
And now we no longer must hear them 
\endverse
\beginchorus
Newbie Drinkers you cannot see 
Newbie Drinker don't puke on me 
The bottle is dry this cannot be 
For now we must open another 
\endchorus
\beginverse
We went to bed for our lawful rest 
But now we face an awful test 
The Newbie Drinkers are retching loud,  
We may not be able to sleep 
\endverse
\beginverse
Poor Lorie dear it was her first time 
To mix the Vodka and Scotch so fine 
To her the Vodka it had no taste 
But the Scotch it did make her to heave 
\endverse
\beginverse
And Doug dear Doug the Experienced man 
Who could not drink with just one hand 
He stumbled back, and he stumbled forth 
Until he could no longer walk 
\endverse
\beginverse
Bob, dear Mom, and Loreena too 
Could not turn backs to these Newbie few 
Yes they would come to the rescue 
Of these Newbie Drinkers 
\endverse
