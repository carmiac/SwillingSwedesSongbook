\beginsong{The Outlands Marches Off to War}[by={James~the~Namer},
                     tune = {The Ants go Marching}]
\beginverse
The Outlands marches off to war
Huzzah, huzzah
At least a hundred men or more
Huzzah, huzzah
The Outlands marches off to war
The King and Queen march in the fore 
\endverse
\beginchorus
And we all go marching down
To the war, in Atenveldt, Oh... 
\endchorus
\beginverse
The Outlands marches off to fight
Fifty spearpoints in the light
The Outlands marches off to fight
A hundred helmets shining bright
\endverse
\beginverse
The Outlands marches off to war
With grand Caid just like before
The Outlands marches off to war
With our Caid brothers from afar
\endverse
\beginverse
The Outlands marches off to fight
A Calontir Fyrdman to our right
The Outlands marches off to fight
The Calontir Fyrdsman ready to strike
\endverse
\beginverse
The Outlands marches off to war
To face the Aten shields galore
The Outlands marches off to war
To fill the Aten fields with gore
\endverse
\beginverse
The Outlands marches off to fight
To take our toll on Atens might
The Outlands marches off to fight
Us each an Aten helm to smite
\endverse
\beginverse
The Outlands won the war that day
Huzzah, huzzah
It's friends we're fighting anyway
Huzzah, huzzah
(slowly)
The Outlands won the war that day
Then we went off to drink and play
With our good friends from the west
In the land, of Atenveldt, oh 
\endverse
