\beginsong{To the Queen}[
    by={James~the~Namer},
]
\beginverse
No belt have I, nor chain, nor crown
Nor circlet on my head
But I seek not for great renown
Just someplace to lay my head.
\endverse
\beginverse
I've raised my swords in wars so vast
For prizes never seen
But now I've found a cause at last
And so my heart does sing
\endverse
\beginverse
I fight these wars because I must
A fire burns inside
Sword brothers all, we share a trust
And so my heart does sing
\endverse
\beginverse
I've fought for friends in wars long past
Alongside warriors bold
But true peace has found me at last
Beneath the Green and Gold
\endverse
\beginverse
The Outlands stands until the end
Renowned where e'er we're seen
I fight not just for Glory friends
I battle for my Queen. 
\endverse
