\beginverse
Of all the money ere I had, I spent it in good company,
And all the harm I've ever done, alas was done to none but me
and all I've done for want of wit, to memory now I can't recall
so fill me to the parting glass, goodnight and joy be with you all.
\endverse
\beginverse
Of all the comrades ere I had, they're sorry for my going away,
and all the sweethearts ere I had , they wish me one more day to stay,
but since it falls unto my lot that I should go and you should not,
I'll gently rise and softly call, goodnight and joy be with you all.
\endverse
\beginverse
If I had money enough to spend and leisure time to sit awhile
there is a fair maid in this town who sorely has my heart beguiled 
Her rosey cheeks and ruby lips, I alone she has my heart in thrall
so fill me to the porting glass goodnight and joy be with you all.
\endverse
