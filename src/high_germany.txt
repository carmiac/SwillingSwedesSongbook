\beginsong{High Germany}
\beginverse
One day as I was walking, and a walkin' all alone
I heard a young couple, a' makin' their moan
Said the older one to the sunder one, "Bonnie lass I must away:
For the King he has commanded us, and His orders I must obey
\endverse
\beginverse
Oh first of all your promises when first you were my love
Was to keep me ever at your side however far you should rove
Pity only take do not me forsake, for great is my love
Through France and Spain, Bonnie Ireland, along with you I'll go.
\endverse
\beginverse
I fear the treacherous journey, bitter cold, and burning heat
Rough cold, and stony mountains, they will wound your tender feet
And to your kinsman to you would prove untrue, if from them you go
For maids must bide at their parent's side, while men do fight the foe
\endverse
\beginverse
I fear no parent's anger, nor any daring foe
Since I have resolved along with you to go
Through the rain and snow, and through weal or woe, I'll prove hard you'll see
For the drums do beat, and the drum that sound, and the wars of High Germany
\endverse
