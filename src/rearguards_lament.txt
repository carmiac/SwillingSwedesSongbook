\beginverse
Would there were someone
To bring me cool water
Sweet Adam's ale,
From the ford near to hand.
\endverse
\beginverse
Would there a priest
Who could pray me to Heaven
And tell me milady
Is safely away.
\endverse
\beginchorus
Fly Lady fly
To Castle Caernarvon
Where the Welsh archers bide
And thy kin still be strong
Fly Lady fly
For the storm's close upon ye
Think well of the laddie
Whose life bought ye time
\endchorus
\beginverse
My faithful war stallion
Stands o'er me protective
To keep away ravens
And Saracen thieves
\endverse
\beginverse   
No more to go hunting
Or charge into battle
The service he renders
The last that I need
\endverse
\beginchorus
Fly Lady fly
To Castle Caernarvon
Where the Welsh archers bide
And thy kin still be strong
Fly Lady fly
For the storm's close upon ye
Think well of the laddie
Whose life bought ye time
\endchorus
\beginverse
Would there were someone
To bring me cool water
Sweet Adam's ale,
From the ford near to hand.
