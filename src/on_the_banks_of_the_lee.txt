\beginsong{On The Banks of the Lee}[by={Traditional}]
\beginverse
Where true lovers meet, beneath the green bower
Where true lovers meet, beneath the green tree
And Mary, fond Mary, she says unto her True Love
You have stolen my young heart, on the banks of the Lee 
\endverse
\beginchorus
For I loved her very dearly, Most truly and sincerely
There is no one in this wide world I love more than she
Every birch, and every bower, every wild Irish flower
Reminds me of my Mary, on the banks of the Lee 
\endchorus
\beginverse
Don't stay out too late love, on the muirlands my Mary
Don't stay out too late love, on the muirlands for me
But little was my notion, when we parted by the Ocean
That we were forever partin', by the banks of the Lee 
\endverse
\beginverse
I will pull my love some roses, some wild Irish roses
I will pull my love some roses, the fairest I see
And I lay them on the gravesite, of my own sweet darlin' Mary
On that cold and silent gravesite, where she sleeps beneath the dew 
\endverse
