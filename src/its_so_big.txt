\beginverse
A cup, a cup, 
My kingdom for a cup. 
Two lords a goin' to the field. 
Without protection had to yield. 
Lord Taran offered his cup; 
The first lord picked it up. 
He went away to try it on, 
To his dismay the size was wrong. 
\endverse
\beginchorus
It's so big; 
It's so incredibly big. 
Can't believe my eyes, 
A magnificent size! 
I'll never fill it up; 
And neither will my friend; 
Or the two of us...together! 
\endchorus
\beginverse
A cup, a cup, 
My kingdom for a cup. 
The feast was ready to be served; 
Without the bowl that it deserved. 
Lord Taran offered his cup; 
A lady picked it up. 
A ladle full she did put in, 
And then the floor did meet her chin. 
\endverse
\beginchorus
It's so big; 
It's so incredibly big. 
Can't believe my eyes, 
A magnificent size! 
I'll never fill it up. 
There's not enough soup at the feast, 
Or the village! 
\endchorus
\beginverse
A cup, a cup, 
My kingdom for a cup. 
A toast the King did wish to make. 
Without a goblet hard to fake. 
Lord Taran offered his cup; 
The King he picked it up. 
Discreetly poured his drink inside, 
And then looked like he nearly died. 
\endverse
\beginchorus
It's so big, 
It's so incredibly big. 
Can't believe my eyes, 
A magnificent size! 
I'll never fill it up. 
Whatta' you think I am? 
I only brought one bottle! 
\endchorus
\beginverse
A cup, a cup, 
My kingdom for a cup. 
Lord Taran was all suited up. 
The one thing missing was his cup. 
A page he found the cup; 
Lord Taran picked it up. 
He went inside to put it on; 
And every lady's eye was drawn. 
\endverse
\beginchorus
It's so big, 
It's so incredibly big. 
Can't believe my eyes, 
A magnificent size! 
I hope he fills it up; 
He better fill it up... 
He's got a legend to live up to now. 
\endchorus
\beginchorus
It's so big; 
It's so incredibly big. 
Can't believe my eyes, 
A magnificent size! 
I hope he fills it up. 
I hope...he fills...it up.
\endchorus
