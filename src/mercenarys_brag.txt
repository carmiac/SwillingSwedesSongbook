\beginsong{Mercenary's Brag}
\beginverse
O' there's many types of warriors that you'll see swagger round,
And each and everyone of them says they're the best that's found,
They'll be short or tall or thin or fat, or young or sometimes old,
But they're all alike in their contempt of those who fight for gold.
\endverse
\beginverse
You can call up peasant levies but they're green and seem to run,
And the men that you've enlisted may desert before you're done,
And the King's elite are fighters but they're all too keen to die,
If you'd a fighter who'll stand by you, then the mercenaries try.
\endverse
\beginchorus
For the mercenary fighter has got fighting in his blood,
And that's what keeps him going when he's wading through the mud,
And there's one thing you can count on, when the deal has been made,
He'll be loyal to your standard just as long as he is paid.
\endchorus
\beginverse
O' but don't you try to cheat him, of the payment he is due,
For that, my friend, is something that you soon will surely rue,
Just the fact that he is living backs his claim that he is good,
You may find a pillaged ruin where before your castle stood.
\endverse
\beginverse
O' there's many kinds of warriors that you'll see swagger round,
And each and everyone of them says they're the best that's to be found,
But the mercenary fighter holds his claim above the rest,
'Cause fighting is his livelihood and that's what he does best.
\endverse
