\beginsong{Anna at the Turning}
\beginverse
Gray in the moonlight, and green in the sun,
Dark in the evening, bright in the dawn,
Ever the meadow goes endlessly on,
And Anna at each turning.
\endverse
\beginverse
Sweet in the springtide, sour in fall,
Winter casts snow, a white velvet caul.
Passage in summer is swiftest of all
And Anna at each turning.
\endverse
\beginverse
Look to the meadows and look to the hills,
Look to the rocks where the swift river spills,
Look to the farmland the farmer still tills
For Anna is returning. 
\endverse
