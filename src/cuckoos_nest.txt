\beginsong{Cuckoos Nest}[by={Modern Traditional}]
\beginverse
There's a fun place in the garden where the lads and lassies meet
For it wouldn't do to do the do they're doing in the street
And the first time I did come there I was very much impressed
By the young folk bust rufflin' up the cuckoos nest 
\endverse
\beginchorus
And it's hi the cuckoo ho the cuckoo hi the cuckoos nest
Hi the cuckoo ho the cuckoo hi the cuckoos nest
I'll give any man a shilling, and a bottle of the best
And ya ruffle up the feathers of the cuckoos nest
\endchorus
\beginverse
I met her in the morning, and I took her in the night
I'd never had another, so I had to do it right
I'd never gone a wingful and I never would have guessed
If she hadn't told me where to find the cuckoos nest
\endverse
\beginverse
And she told me where to find it and she told me where to go
Through the prickles and the brambles where the little people go
And the minute that I found it she would never let me rest
'Till I ruffled up the feathers of the cuckoos nest
\endverse
\beginverse
It was blarney it was prickled it was feathered all around
It was tucked into a corner and it wasn't easy found
She said "God man you're buggering" I said it wasn't true
And I left her with the makings of a young cuckoo 
\endverse
