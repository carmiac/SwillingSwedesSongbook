\beginverse
The first time I sent my device the heralds said to me:
It violates the Rule of Three 
\endverse
\beginverse
The next time I tried it, the heralds said to me:
We changed the forms, and 
It violates the Rule of Three!
\endverse
\textnote{...to save space...}
\beginverse
The LAST time I sent my device, the Heralds said to me:
Someone else has got it, 
We changed the rules again,
It's not a period design, 
It's against the Rule of Tincture,
We changed the rules,
\textnote{In a fast Gregorian Monotone}
In a decision rendered by the College of Arms
on August 1'st, A.S. V it was decided that this
Style of Heraldic Design was not appropriate to
the aims and intentions of the Corporate Body
Holy! Holy! Holy! 
\textnote{Back to singing}
We haven't got it, 
We upped the fees, 
We changed the forms, and 
It violates the Rule of Three 
\endverse
