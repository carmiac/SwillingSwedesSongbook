\beginverse
You may talk and sing and boast about your Pennsic Wars and Floods,
And how the fields of Atenveldt at wars are filled with blood,
But I'll sing to you a story of a destiny filled date,
How we took the field against the winds at last Estrella VIII.
\endverse
\beginchorus
The winds and gales they blew and kept on coming,
The tents they flew and people started running,
And when we got back to our camp, we found it was too late,
For the winds had taken everything at last Estrella VIII.
\endchorus
\beginverse
We came with tents and armored knights, we came with all we could;
We came with spirit and with sword, we came with flesh and blood,
We came with everything we might, the kitchen sink we brought,
But the winds were just a little bit stronger than we thought.
\endverse
\beginverse
Now the last thing that I noticed, that gave to me great hope,
And inspired all the people round, who'd reached the end of rope,
Was a view of such tremendous strength, so glorious and bright,
Aye the stronghold was a flyin' on a ninety-nine foot kite!
\endverse
