\beginsong{Life By The Sword}[by={Traditional}]
\beginverse
William in his castle lay, sword and shield beside him
A lovely lady at his side, but alas he lay there dying
Far away the sounds were heard, the screams of men and fighting
The ring of steel rang through the air, his castle lay in ruins
\endverse
\beginverse
Closing his eyes he lay back his head, clutching his lady to him
And he dreamed a last dream of an age that might come
When the sword would be laid down for good
\endverse
\beginverse
His lady washed away the dirt, on his face, from the dust of battle
But even her tender gentleness, did ought to soothe her sorrow
In the courtyard below, the enemy swarmed, in droves of hundreds to thousands
Destroying resistance wherever it came, the battle would soon be over
\endverse
\beginverse
Life by the sword is noble at best, but higher is the price you pay
And the one who will win is the one who's named Death
Till the sword is laid down for good
\endverse
\beginverse
Now all that stands of his castle today, is a pile of stones and rubble
The bones of the men have long since decayed, their glories been forgotten
\endverse
\beginverse
Life by the sword is noble at best, but higher is the price you pay
And the one who will win is the one who's named Death
Till the sword is laid down for good 
\endverse
