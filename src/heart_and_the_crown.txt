\beginverse
They rode into town
On the thirteenth of Spring.
She have him her hand
And he gave her his ring.
She gave him her heart
And he gave her his crown,
But they never, no never
Went down derry down derry down.
\endverse
\beginverse
Her horse was pure white
And his horse was gray
She wanted to go
But he asked her to stay.
She gave him her heart
And he gave her his crown,
But they never, no never
Went down derry down derry down.
\endverse
\beginverse
Her eyes were pure black
And his eyes were so blue.
She wanted him strong
And he wanted her true.
She gave him her heart
And he gave her his crown,
But they never, no never
Went down derry down derry down.
\endverse
\beginverse
Come all ye fair maidens,
And listen to me,
If you want your young man
To be strong and free
Just give him your heart
And he' ll give you his crown
Just as long as you never
Go down derry down derry down.
