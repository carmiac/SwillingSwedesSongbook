\beginverse
Three gypsies came to our hall door,
They came brave and boldly, Oh,
And the one sang high, and the other sang low,
Made the lady sing the wraggle taggle gypsy, Oh.
\endverse
\beginverse
Upstairs and down, the lady went,
She put on silk and leather, Oh,
And the cry's gone up all around the door,
She's away with the wraggle taggle gypsy, Oh.
\endverse
\beginverse
Well, late last night the lord came home,
Inquiring for his lady, Oh,
And the serving girls replied to him all,
She's away with the wraggle taggle gypsy, Oh.
\endverse
\beginverse
The saddle for me, the fastest steed,
My big horse is not speedy, Oh,
I'll ride far and wide to seek for my bride,
She's away with the wraggle taggle gypsy, Oh.
\endverse
\beginverse
He rode fast east, and he rode west,
He rode north and south, also,
And it's when he has come to the wide open field,
It's there that he's found his lady, Oh.
\endverse
\beginverse
Oh, why would you leave your house and lands,
Why would you leave your money, Oh,
Why would you leave your only wedded lord,
To follow with the wraggle taggle gypsy, Oh.
\endverse
\beginverse
Oh, what do I care for my house and land,
What care I for money, Oh,
What do I care for my only wedded lord,
When I can have my wraggle taggle gypsy, Oh.
\endverse
\beginverse
Last night you slept in your goose feather bed,
With the sheets turned down so boldly, Oh,
Tonight you lie in the wide open field,
In the arms of the wraggle taggle gypsy, Oh.
\endverse
\beginverse
Oh, what do I care for a goose feather bed,
And sheets to turn so boldly, Oh,
When I can lie in the wide open field,
In the arms of my wraggle taggle gypsy, Oh.
\endverse
\beginverse
For you rode east, and I rode west,
You rode high and I rode low,
I'd rather have the kiss of my yellow gypsy's lips,
Than all of your cache of money, Oh.
\endverse
\beginverse
Three gypsies came to our hall door,
They came brave and boldly, Oh,
And the one sang high, and the other sang low,
And the lady sang the wraggle taggle gypsy, Oh.
