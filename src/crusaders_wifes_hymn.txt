\beginsong{Crusader's Wife's Hymn}[by={Mistress Alison Mac Kieran Dhu },
                     tune = {On top of Old Smokey }]
\beginverse
O, I am a lady, my husband's a lord.
A true knightly warrior, and God! I am bored.
\endverse
\beginverse
The knights are called gentle and by birth they are.
But I prefer minstrels, they're sweeter by far.
\endverse
\beginverse
He's fearless in melees, he's first at the chase.
But when around ladies, falls flat on his face.
\endverse
\beginverse
He curses most roundly, and colorfully too.
But ask him for soft words, he hasn't a clue.
\endverse
\beginverse
My lord is a true knight, fights rather than thinks.
Excepting in battle, his swordsmanship stinks.
\endverse
\beginverse
My lord is crusading, I shall at home stay.
And I'll not be pining while he is away.
\endverse
\beginverse
But my lord can trust me, I care not to roam.
The lay of the minstrel will keep me at home! 
\endverse
