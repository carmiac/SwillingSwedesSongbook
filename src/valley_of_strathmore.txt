\beginverse
By the clear and winding streams
Of the valley of Strathmore
Where my love and I have been
Where we wander nevermore 
\endverse
\beginchorus
But if time were a thing man could buy
All the money that I have in store
I would give for one day by her side
In the Valley of Strathmore 
\endchorus
\beginverse
From the glen of the golden an' green
I have left for a land far away
Where sadness has ne'er been seen
And joy only costs a day's pay 
\endverse
\beginverse
In Strathmore theres a long workin' day
For the man who lays hands on the hill
But it's work I'd be happy to do
If at night I was lyin' with you 
\endverse
\beginverse
As I take a long draught from my glass
I am drinkin the Long Hill again
But I try no to think on my loss
For the old days will ne'er come again 
\endverse
