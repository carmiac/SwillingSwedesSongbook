There is a house in al-Barran,
They call the Fervent Kip
Has been the ruin of many young lords
That's where I made my slip

\beginverse
My father was an English Knight
My mom a maid of France
And had they but taught me a few facts of life
I might have had a chance
\endverse

I wandered far from home one night
When I was just a kid
I stopped and asked them to show me the way
And that's just what they did
\endverse
\beginverse
I left my home an honest lad
My innocence assured
When I returned the following morn'
My weakness had been cured
\endverse
\beginverse
I've studied long with sages wise
And scholars most astute
But they've taught me less than that single night
In a house of ill repute
\endverse
\beginverse
There is a house in al-Barran
It's called the Fervent Kip
Has been the ruin of many young lords
That's where I made my slip
