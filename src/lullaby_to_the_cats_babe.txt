\beginsong{Lullaby to the Cat's Babe}
\beginverse
Hush, little mountain cat, sleep in your den,
I'll sing of your mother who cradled fair Jen.
I'll sing of your mother who covered Jen's skin.
Flesh of your flesh did sweet Jenna lie in. 
\endverse
\beginverse
Sleep, little catkin,
Perchance you shall dream
Of rabbit and pheasant, and trout in the stream.
But Jenna will dream of the dark and the light.
Your mother will shelter her from the cold night. 
\endverse
