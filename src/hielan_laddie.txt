\beginverse
As I came o'er the Cairney Mount
An' doon anang the bloomin' heather
The Heilan' laddie drew his dirk
And sheathed it in my wanton leather 
\endverse

Oh my bonnie Heilan' laddie
Ma handsome bonnie Heilan' laddie
When I'm sick an like tae dee
He'll row me in his tartan plaidee
\endchorus
\beginverse
Wi me he played his warlike pranks
An on me boldly did adventure
He did attack me on baith flanks
an pushed me firecely in the center 
\endverse
\beginverse
A furious ficht we did maintain
Wi equal courage an desire
Although he charged me three tae one
I stood ma ground an took his fire
