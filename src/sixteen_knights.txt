\beginsong{Sixteen Knights}[
  tune={Sixteen Tons}]
\beginverse  
Some people say a knight's made outta mud,
But a stick jock's made outta muscle and blood.
Muscle and blood and plate and mail,
A mind that's weak and an arm of hail.
\endverse
\beginchorus
Ya fight sixteen knights and what do ya get?
Another bruised shoulder and deeper in debt,
Duke Frederick (or another duke) don't call me cuz I can't go.
I owe my soul to the armorer's store.
\endchorus
\beginverse
I was born one morning when the sun didn't shine,
I got some rattan and went in the line.
I found sixteen knights to pulverize,
And the Earl Marshal cried authorized.
\endverse
\beginverse
Well I fight real clean and I fight real fair,
At least when there's a marshal there
I take any blow that hits me right,
But there aren't too man cuz they all feel light.
\endverse
\beginverse
Well if ya see me comin' better step aside,
A lot of knights didn't and a lot of knights died.
I can fight any style and make my kill,
If my mace don't get you my broad sword will.
\endverse
\beginverse
Well I'm thirty years old and I'm a master, too.
I won crown tourney it was easy to do.
I'm a duke thrice over, give me my due.
I can beat Duke Paul and I can beat you too.
\endverse
\beginverse
Ya find sixteen knights and what do ya get?
Another bruised shoulder and deeper in debt,
Duke Frederick (or another duke) don't call me cuz I can't go.
I owe my soul to the armorer's store.
