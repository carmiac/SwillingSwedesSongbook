\beginsong{Flower O'Scotland}[by={Roy~MB~Williamson}]
\beginverse
O Flower of Scotland
When will we see
Your like again,
That fought and died for
Your wee bit hill and glen
And stood against him
Proud Edward's Army,
And sent him homeward
Tae think again.
\endverse
\beginverse
The hills are bare now
And autumn leaves lie thick and still
O'er land that is lost now
Which those so dearly held
That stood against him
Proud Edward's Army
And sent him homeward
Tae think again.
\endverse
\beginverse
Those days are past now
And in the past they must remain
But we can still rise now
And be the nation again
That stood against him
Proud Edward's Army
And sent him homeward,
Tae think again.
\endverse
