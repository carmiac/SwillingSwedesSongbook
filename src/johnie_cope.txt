\beginsong{Johnnie Cope}[by={Adam Skirving}]
\beginverse
Hey, Johnnie Cope, are you wauking yet?
Or are your drums a-beating yet?
If ye were wauking I wad wait
To gang to the coals in the morning
\endverse
\beginverse
Cope sent a challenge frae Dunbar
"Charlie meet me an ye daur,
An I'll learn you the art o' war
If you'll meet me in the morning"
\endverse
\beginverse
When Charlie looked the letter upon,
He drew his sword the scabbard from
"Come follow me, my merry men,
An' we'll meet Johnnie Cope in the morning!"
\endverse
\beginverse
"Now Johnnie, be as good as your word
Come, let us try both fire and sword
And dinna rin like a frightened bird
That's chased frae it's nest in the morning"
\endverse
\beginverse
When Johnnie Cope he heard of this
He thought it wad'na be amiss
To hae his horse in readiness
To flee awa' in the morning
\endverse
\beginverse
Fly now Johnnie, get up and rin
The Highlands bagpipes make a din
It's best to sleep in a hale skin
For 'Twill be a bluidy morning
\endverse
\beginverse
When Johnnie cope to Dunbar came
They sneered at him, "Where's a' your men?"
"The Deil confound me gin I ken
For I left them a' in the morning
\endverse
\beginverse
Now Johnnie, Troth, ya are na blate
To come wi' the news o' your ain defeat
And leave your men in sae a strait
Sae early in the morning
\endverse
\beginverse
"I' faith" quo Johnnie " I got a fleg
Wi' their claymores and phillabegs
If I face them again, Deil break my legs!
Else I wish you a gud morning" 
\endverse
