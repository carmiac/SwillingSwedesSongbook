\beginsong{Come Free, Damned Chastity Belt}[by={ Odd Celts of St. Golias},
                     tune = {Swing Low Sweet Chariot}]
\beginchorus
Come free, damned chastity belt
Keepin' me from where I wanna go
Come free, damned chastity belt
Quick before her husband comes home
\endchorus
\beginverse
I gazed at her body, an' what did I see
Keepin me from where I wanna be
That cruel contraption lookin' back at me
Where did he hide that key!
\endverse
\beginverse
I searched high and low for that damned key
where in the hell could it be?
I've got a hard on stiff as a tree
I've got to get that damned thing free!!
\endverse
\beginverse
I looked out the window and over the lea
Past the cliff out leagues three
Her husbands vessel comin' in from sea
Pretty soon I'll have to flee 
\endverse
