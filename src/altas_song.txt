\beginsong{Alta's Song}
\beginverse
I am a babe, an only babe,
Fire and water and all,
Who in my mother's womb was made,
Great Alta take my soul.
\endverse
\beginverse
But from that mother I was torn,
Fire and water and all,
And to a hillside I was borne,
Great Alta Take my soul.
\endverse
\beginverse
And on that hillside was I laid,
Fire and water and all,
And taken up all by a maid,
Great Alta save my soul.
\endverse
\beginverse
And one and two and three we rode?
Fire and water and all,
Till others took the heavy load,
Great Alta take my soul.
\endverse
\beginverse
Let all good women hark to me,
Fire and water and all,
For fostering shall set thee free,
Great Alta save my soul. 
\endverse
