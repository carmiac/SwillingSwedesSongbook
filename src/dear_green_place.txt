\beginsong{The Dear Green Place}
\beginverse
It was a clear mornin' down near Bann
Where it meets and runs with the river Clyde
And they tell the tale of the holy one
Who was fishing down by the riverside
The holy man, from Fife he came
His name they say was Kentirgen
And by the spot where the fish was caught
The Dear Green Place was born
Though the salmon run through the river stream
And they salted them by the banks of Clyde
And their faces glow'd as the silver flow'd
And the place that rose by the riverside
There was cloth and dye and horse to buy
the traders came from all around
And they raised a glass to the Dear Green Place
The place that was a town 
\endverse
\beginchorus
There is a town that once was green
And the river flow'd to the sea
The river flows forever on
But the Dear Green Place is gone 
\endchorus
\beginverse
When the furnaces came to fire the iron
And folk were thrown from foreign land
And the Irishman and the Heilan' man
And the hungry man came with willin' hands
They wanted work, a place to live
Their empty bellies needed filled
And the farmyard was another world
From the diety overcrow'd mill
Now you may have heard of the foreign trade
And fortunes made by tobacco lords
But the workin' man slaved his life away
And an early grave was his sole reward
A dreary room, a crowded slum
Disease and hunger everywhere
And the price to pay was another day
And fight the anger and despair 
\endverse
\beginverse
A thousand years have been here and gone
Since Kentiergan saw the banks of Clyde
But how many dreams and how many tears
In the thousand years of a city's life
A city hard a city proud
No mean city it has been
Perhaps tomorrow it yet may be
The Dear Green Place again... 
\endverse
