\beginverse

I've been a wild rover for many a year,
And I've spent all my money on whiskey and beer,
But now I'm returning with gold in great store,
And I never will play the wild rover no more.
\endverse
\beginchorus
And it's no, nay, never. No, nay, never, no more, |
Will I play the rover. No never, no more. |
\endchorus
\beginverse
I went to an ale house I used to frequent,
And I told the landlady my money was spent.
I asked her for credit, she answered me nay.
Such custom like yours I could have any day.
\endverse
\beginverse
I took from my pocket ten sovereigns bright,
And the landlady's eyes opened wide with delight,
She said, "I have whiskeys and wines of the best,
And I'll take you upstairs, and I'll show you the rest."
\endverse
\beginverse
I'll go home to my parents, confess what I've done,
And I'll ask them to pardon their prodigal son.
And if they caress me as oft times before,
I never will play the wild rover no more!
\endverse
