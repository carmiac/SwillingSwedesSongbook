\beginverse
Three fishers went sailing out into the west
Out into the west as the sun went down
Each thought on the woman that loved him the best, and
The children stood watching them out of the town
\endverse
\beginchorus
For men must work and women must weep
For there's little to earn and many to keep, and
The harbour bar be moanin', and
The harbour bar be moanin'
\endchorus
\beginverse
Three wives sat up in the lighthouse tower
They trimmed the lamps as the sun went down, and
They looked at the squall and they looked at the shower, and
The night-wrack came rollin' in, ragged and brown
\endverse
\beginchorus
For men must work and women must weep
Though storms be sud - den and the waters be deep, and
The harbour bar be moanin', and
The Harbour bar be moanin'
\endchorus
\beginverse
Three corpses lay out on the shining sand
In the morning gleam as the tide went down, and
The women were weepin' and wringin' their hands
For those who would never come back to the town
\endverse
\beginchorus
For men must work and women must weep, and
The sooner it's over, the sooner to sleep, and
Good - bye to the bar and its moanin', and
Good - bye to the bar and it's moanin'
\endchorus
\beginverse
Oh men must work and women must weep, and
The sooner it's over, the sooner to sleep, and
Good - bye to the bar and its moanin', and
Good - bye to the bar and it's moanin'
\endverse
\endsong
