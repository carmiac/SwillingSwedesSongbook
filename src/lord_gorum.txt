\beginsong{Lord Gorum}
\beginverse
O where have you been all day, Gorum, my son?
The bull, the bear, the cat and hound,
Where have you been all day, my pretty one?
And the brothers have pulled me down.
\endverse
\beginverse
I've been far afoot, with my staff in my hand,
The bull, the bear, the cat, and the hound,
I have been out walking my dead father's land,
And the brothers have pulled me down.
\endverse
\beginverse
I looked in the mountains, I looked in the sea,
The bull, the bear, the cat, and the hound,
A looking for someone a looking for me,
And the brothers have pulled me down.
\endverse
\beginverse
What have ye for supper, Lord Gorum, my son?
The bull, the bear, the cat, and the hound,
What have ye for supper, my pretty young one?
And the brothers have pulled me down.
\endverse
\beginverse
I've nothing for supper and nothing to rise,
The bull, the bear, the cat, and the hound,
But fed on the look in my own true love's eyes,
And the brothers have pulled me down.
\endverse
\beginverse
What will ye leave to that true love, my son?
The bull, the bear, the cat, and the hound.
What will she leave you, my handsome young one?
And the brothers have pulled me down.
\endverse
\beginverse
My kingdom, my crown, my name, and my grave,
The bull the bear the cat and the hound,
Her hair, her heart, her place in the cave,
And the brothers have pulled me down.
