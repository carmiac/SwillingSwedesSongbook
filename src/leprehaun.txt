\beginsong{Leprehaun}
\beginverse
In a shady nook one moonlight night
A leprechaun I spied,
With scarlet cap and coat of green;
A cruiskenn by his side.
'Twas a tick tack tick, his hammer went,
Upon a tiny shoe,
And I laughed to think of a purse of gold;
But the fairy was laughing too! 
\endverse
\beginverse
With a tip toe step and beating heart,
Quite softly I drew nigh:
There was mischief in his merry face;
A twinkle in his eye.
He hammered and sang with tiny voice,
And drank his mountain dew;
And I laughed to think he was caught at last:
But the fairy was laughing too! 
\endverse
\beginverse
As quick as thought I seized the elf;
"Your fairy purse!" I cried;
"The purse!" he said "'tis in her hand
"That lady at your side!"
I turned to look: the elf was off!
Then what was I to do?
O, I laughed to think what a fool I'd been;
And the fairy was laughing too! 
\endverse
