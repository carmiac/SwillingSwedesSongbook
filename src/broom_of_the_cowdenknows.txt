\beginsong{The Broom of the Cowdenknows}
\beginverse
How blithe was I each morn to see
My love come o'er the hill.
I jumped the stream, and she flew to me,
And met me with good will.
\endverse
\beginchorus
Oh, the broom, the bonny, bonny broom,
The broom of the Cowdenknows.
I wish I was in my own homeland,
There with my own true love.
\endchorus
\beginverse
I worried not for ewes or lambs,
While both our flocks near me lay.
I gathered in our sheep at night,
And she cheered me all the day.
\endverse
\beginverse
She tuned her harp, and strummed so sweet,
The birds stood listening by.
E'en the dull cattle stood and gazed,
Charmed by her melody.
\endverse
\beginverse
While, thus, we spent our time by turns,
Betwixt our flocks and play,
I envied not the fairest lad,
Though ne'er so rich and gay.
\endverse
\beginverse
She did oblige me every hour,
Could I but faithful be?
She stole my heart, could I refuse,
What e'er she asked of me?
\endverse
\beginverse
Hard fate that I should banished be,
Gang heavily with morn,
Because I loved the dearest lass,
That ever yet was born.
\endverse
\beginverse
Adieu, ye Cowdenknows adieu,
Farewell all pleasures there.
Ye gods restore me to my love
Is all I want or care.
\endverse
