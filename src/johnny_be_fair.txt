\beginsong{Johnny Be Fair}[by={Buffy St. Marie}]
\beginverse
O Johnny be fair and Johnny be fine and wants me for to wed,
And I would marry Johnny, but me father up and said:
"I'm sad to tell you daughter what your mother never knew,
That Johnny is a son of mine and so is kin to you"'.
\endverse
\beginverse
O Billy be fair and Billy be fine...
\endverse
\beginverse
O Michael be fair and Michael be fine...
\endverse
\beginverse
You never saw a sorrier lass, or sadder, than I was,
A-kin to every lad in town, me father is the cause!
If things should thus continue I will die a single miss,
So I should run to mother and complain to her of this!
\endverse
\beginverse
Now haven't I told you daughter to forgive and to forget?
For though your father's sown his wild oats, you needn't fret,
He may have sired every single lad in town, but still,
He's not the one who sired YOU so marry who you will!
\endverse
