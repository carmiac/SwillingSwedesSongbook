\beginsong{The Chill Eastern Winds}
\beginverse
Prepare you sweet flowers, for winter advances
And drink well the sunlight that touches your form
Draw strength from the Earth, and repay her with beauty
For the dark days are comin', oh, and they'll do y' harm
\endverse
\beginchorus
When the chill eastern winds replace summer breezes
And the long summer days are remembered no more
Then you'll know how it feels when a woman's love changes
When at last she has told you she loves you no more
\endchorus
\beginverse
I saw her today when she walked with her new love
In all the fine places that we'd walked before
They kissed by the rocks where she told me she loved me
And soon she'll be using those same words once more
\endverse
\beginverse
There's none that could blame me for wanting her beauty
But it lies like a snowflake in the hands of a child
When the warmth of my love tried to reach out and hold her
It's then she was gone, to prove she's still wild 
\endverse
