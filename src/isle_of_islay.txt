\beginsong{Isle of Islay}
\beginverse
How high the gulls fly o'er Islay,
How sad the farm land deep in plague,
Felt like the grain on your sand.
\endverse
\beginverse
How well the sleep's bill music makes,
Roving the cliffs where fancy takes
Felt like a tide left me here.
\endverse
\beginverse
How blessed the forest with birds song,
How neat the cut peat laid so long,
Fell like a seed on your land.
\endverse
\beginverse
Felt like a tide left me here,
Felt like a grain on your sand,
Felt like a grain on your sand.
