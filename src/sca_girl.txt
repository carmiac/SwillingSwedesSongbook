\beginverse
Well I went down to Citadel
And I slept in a park
Went on up to Caer Mithen
For a tourney in the dark 
\endverse
\beginchorus
And I'll search the world over
For my Lady in Garb
Yeah, I'll search the world over
For an SCA Girl 
\endchorus
\beginverse
Cruised on out to Outlandish
Nearly blew me away
Yeah, the wind there was awful
But I stayed anyway
\endverse
\beginverse
Got drunk at St. Golias
They put me up for the night
Now I always have liked them
The way they drink, and they fight
\endverse
\beginverse
Called my Knight from a pay phone
Said I'm down to my last
He said "I gave you your armor
Now go call your dad"
\endverse
\beginverse
And the Duchess that he married
Well she hung up the phone
No she never did like me
But I can stand on my own
\endverse
\beginverse
Sold my armor at Pennsic
Spent it all in one night
Buyin' drinks in a tavern
For a guy who don't fight
\endverse
\beginverse
Cruised on out to Estrella
Atens Piped on the field
Yeah they still lost the war though
Never had time to yield 
\endverse
