\beginsong{Such a Parcel of Rouges }[
    by={Robert~Burns },
]
\beginverse
Fareweel to a' our Scottish fame
Fareweel our ancient glory
Fareweel ev'n to the Scottish name
Sae famed in martial story
Now Sarkrins o'er the Solway sands
An' Tweed runs to the ocean
To mark where England's province stands
Such a parcel of rogues in a nation 
\endverse
\beginverse
What force or guile could not subdue
Thro' many warlike ages
Is wrought now by a coward few
For hireling traitor's wages
The English steel we could disdain
Secure in valors station;
But English gold has been our bane-
Such a parcel of rogues in a nation 
\endverse
\beginverse
O, would, or had I seen the day
That Treason thus could sell us
My auld grey head had lien in clay
Wi' Bruce and loyal Wallace
But pith and power, till my last hour
I'll make this declaration-
"We were bought and sold for English gold"
Such a parcel of rogues in a nation 
\endverse
