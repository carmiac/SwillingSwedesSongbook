\beginverse
In early May, when skies are gay 
And green the plains and mountains, 
At break of day I rose to play 
Beside a little fountain. 
\endverse
\beginverse
In garden close where shone the rose 
I heard a fiddle played, then 
A handsome knight that charmed my sight, 
Was dancing with a maiden. 
\endverse
\beginverse
Both fair of face, they turned with grace 
To tread their May-time measure. 
The flowering place, their close embrace: 
Their kisses brought them pleasure. 
\endverse
\beginverse
But shortly they had slipped away 
To stroll among the bowers. 
To ease their heart, each played his part 
In love's games on the flowers. 
\endverse
\beginverse
I crept ahead, all chill with dread, 
Lest someone there should see me. 
Bemused and sad because I had 
No joy in love to please me. 
\endverse
\beginverse                                       
Then one of those I'd seen their rose 
And from afar off speaking, 
He questioned me, who I might be, 
And what I came there seeking. 
\endverse
\beginverse
I stepped their way to sadly say 
How long I'd loved a lady, 
Who all my days my heart obeys, 
Full faithfully and steady. 
\endverse
\beginverse
Though still I bore a grief so sore 
In losing one so lovely, 
That surely I would come to die 
Unless she deigned to love me. 
\endverse
\beginverse
With wisdom rare, with tactful air 
They counselled and relieved me. 
They said their prayer was God might spare 
Some joy in love that grieved me. 
\endverse
\beginverse
Where all my gain was loss and pain 
So I in turn extended 
My thanks sincere, with many a tear, 
And them to God commended. 
\endverse
