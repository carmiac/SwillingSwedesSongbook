Welcome to your gory bed,
Or to victory.

See the front o' battle lour;
See approach proud Edward's power,
Chains and slavery.

Wha sae base as be a Slave?
Let him turn and fly:

Freedom's sword will strongly draw,
Free-man stand, or free-man fa',

By Oppression's woes and pains!
By your Sons in servile chains!
We will drain our dearest veins,
But they shall be free!

Tyrants fall in every foe!
Liberty's in every blow!
Let us Do - or Die!!!
