\beginsong{The Streets of Ann Arbor}[
    by={W.J.~Bethancourt~III },

\beginverse
As I walked out thru the streets of Ann Arbor
As I walked out thru Ann Arbor one day
I spied a young Mongol all dressed in white linen
All dressed in white linen and cold as the clay
\endverse
\beginverse
I then spied another, done in on the sidewalk
Along with just about six dozen more
Their wounds were all gaping, from mace and from broadsword
From claymore and cannon, all dripping with gore
\endverse
\beginverse
What caused this grave carnage, I cried to the Mongols
Oh pray what's the reason for this awful sight
My answer came slowly from under the corpse-pile
"It seems that our bark is much worse than our bite....."
\endverse
\beginverse
The answer continued from pale lips a-shaking
We sang all our songs and believed them as true
The Dark Horde could never be beaten in battle
We thought this was what all good Mongols could do...
\endverse
\beginverse
We went down to Atenveldt all for to plunder
"Too large to defend" was our song every night
But Atenveldt's different from East, West or Middle
There, even the bushes have learned how to bite!
\endverse
\beginverse
The Clann stole our ponies, the Scraelings our foodstuffs
We ran into axes in Viking hands
Our maidens ran off with one Richard of Arkham
And we're all that's left to return to our lands
\endverse
\beginverse
MacChluarains and Monsters, Lockehaven and Foxmoor
That Kingdom is BIG and its fighters are MEAN!
We fought and we lost, and fled back to Ann Arbor
We all came back home with results that you've seen
\endverse
\beginverse
Keep away from that land with its cactus and marshes
It's no place for Mongols who are bent on War
They count their blows well, but they strike them yet better
He crawled into his Yurt, and fell, dead, on the floor..... 
\endverse
