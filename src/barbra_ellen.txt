\beginsong{Barb'ra Ellen}
\beginverse
In scarlet town where I was born,
There was a fair maid dwellin';
Made ev'ry youth cry, Well-a-day!
And her name was Barb'ra Ellen,
\endverse
\beginverse
Twas in the merry month of May,
When green buds they were swellin'.
Sweet William on this deathbed lay
For the love of Barb'ra Ellen
\endverse
\beginverse
He sent a servant to the town,
To the place where she was dwellin'.
"My master's sick and he bids you come
If your name be Barb'ra Ellen.
\endverse
\beginverse
Then slowly, slowly she got up,
And slowly she went nigh him;
And as she drew the curtain back:
"Young man, I think you're dyin!"
\endverse
\beginverse
"O, ken you not in yonder town,
In the place where we were dwellin',
You gave a health to the ladies all,
But you slighted Barb'ra Ellen."
\endverse
\beginverse
"O, yes I ken. I ken it well.
In the place where we were dwellin',
I gave a health to the ladies all,
But my love to Barb'ra Ellen."
\endverse
\beginverse
Then slowly went she down the stairs.
He trembled like an aspen.
"Be kind, good friends and neighbors all,
Be kind to Barb'ra Ellen."
\endverse
\beginverse
And as she cross'd the wooded fields,
She heard his deathbell knellin',
And ev'ry stroke, it spoke her name
"Hard-hearted Barb'ra Ellen."
\endverse
\beginverse
She look'd to the east, she looked to the west.
She saw his corpse a comin'.
"O bearers, bearers, lay him down,
For I think I too am dying'."
\endverse
\beginverse
"O, Mother, Mother, make my bed,
And make it long and narrow.
Sweet William died for the love of me;
I'll die for him of sorrow!"
\endverse
\beginverse
"O, Father, Father, dig my grave,
And dig it deep and narrow.
Sweet William died for me today.
I'll die for him tomorrow."
\endverse
\beginverse
They buried her in the old churchyard.
They buried him beside her,
And from his heart grew a red, red rose,
And from her heart a briar.
\endverse
\beginverse
They climb'd right up the old church wall
Till they couldn't climb no higher.
They tied themselves in a true lovers' knot,
The red rose Ã«round the briar.
\endverse
