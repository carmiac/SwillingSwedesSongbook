\beginsong{The Ballad of William Bloat}[by={Traditional}]
\beginverse
In a mean abode on the Skankill Road
Lived a man named William Bloat;
He had a wife, the curse of his life,
Who continually got his goat.
\endverse
\beginverse
So one day at dawn, with her nightdress on
He cut her bloody throat.
With a razor gash he settled her hash
Oh never was crime so quick
\endverse
\beginverse
But the drip drip drip on the pillowslip'
Of her lifeblood made him sick.
And the pool of gore on the bedroom floor
Grew clotted and cold and thick.
\endverse
\beginverse
Now he was glad he had done what he had
When she lay there stiff and still
But a sudden awe of the angry law
Shuck his heart with an icy chill.
\endverse
\beginverse
So to finish the fun so well begun
He decided himself to kill.
He took the sheet from the wife's coul' feet
And twisted it into a rope
\endverse
\beginverse
And he hanged himself from the pantry shelf,
'Twas an easy end, let's hope.
In the face of death with his latest breath
He solemnly cursed the Pope.
\endverse
\beginverse
But the strangest turn to the whole concern
Is only just beginning.
He went to Hell but his wife got well
And she's still alive and sinning
For the razor blade was English made
But the sheet was Belfast linen. 
\endverse
