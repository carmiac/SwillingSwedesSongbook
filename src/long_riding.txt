\beginsong{The Long Riding}
\beginverse
Into the valley
Come riding, come riding,
Into the meadow and into the dell,
Into the moonlight where shadows are gliding, 
\endverse
\beginchorus
Into the forest where enemies hiding,
Riding riding,
Three come a riding
Three come a riding
Into the mouth of hell. 
\endchorus
\beginverse
Into the village,
Come riding, come riding,
Into the hames where the sweet women dwell,
Into the rests where the men are a biding. 
\endverse
\beginchorus
Into the forest where enemies hiding,
Riding riding,
Three come a riding
Three come a riding
Into the mouth of hell. 
\endchorus
