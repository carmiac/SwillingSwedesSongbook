\beginsong{Molly Malone II}[by={Ioseph~of~Locksley},
                     tune = {Molly Malone}]
\beginverse
In Dublin's fair city, where the girls have no titties
'Twas there that I first met sweet Molly Malone
You could have her for a penny, and be one of many,
But for sixpence she would act alive, alive-o!
\endverse
\beginchorus
Alive, alive-o! Alive alive-o!
But for sixpence she would act alive, alive-o!
\endchorus
\beginverse
She was a street walker, and sure 'twas no wonder
For so were her mother and grandmother too,
With a mattress on the barrow, thru streets broad and narrow,
And for sixpence they would act alive, alive-o!
\endverse
\beginverse
She died of a fever, and no one could save her;
It was caught from a folkie from Ontario,
Now her ghost wheels the barrow thru streets broad and narrow
But a ghost can't be had that's alive, alive-o!
\endverse
\beginchorus
Alive, alive-o! Alive alive-o!
But a ghost can't be had that's alive, alive-o!
\endchorus
