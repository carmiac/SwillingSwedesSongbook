\beginsong{The Isla Waters}[by={Andy Stewart, Martin Hadden}]
\beginverse
I hae' friends, they buy me whisky
Bonnie friends they call my name
But if I should get too drunk for walkin'
Where's the man that would carry me hame 
\endverse
\beginchorus
And if I be drunk in the Isla Waters
Through the Thistlewood I must hame
If I be drunk in the Isla Waters
My wee doggie would find me in the Isla Stream 
\endchorus
\beginverse
All the day I bless that water
Aye she's bricht an' clear to see
But after hours o' ale hoose laughter
Dark an' still she waits for me 
\endverse
\beginverse
Like the fishers line that's broken
Leaves the salmon tae the swell
Many's the nicht you've had me soakin'
Part tae break the lyer's hell 
\endverse
\beginverse
All my days I've lived tae court her
Bauden bonny fine stuff I've seen
But should I droun in yuir water
My wee doggie would find me in the Isla Stream 
\endverse
