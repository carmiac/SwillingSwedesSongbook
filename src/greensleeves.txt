\beginsong{Greensleeves}
\beginverse
Alas my love, you do me wrong
To cast me off discourteously,
And I have loved you so long,
Delighting in your company. 
\endverse
\beginchorus
Greensleeves was all my joy,
Greensleeves was my delight;
Greensleeves was my heart of gold,
And who but Lady Greensleeves? 
\endchorus
\beginverse
I have been ready at your hand,
To grant whatever you would crave;
I have both waged life and land,
Your love and good will for to have.
\endverse
\beginverse
I bought thee kerchiefs for thy head,
That were wrought fine and gallantly;
I kept thee both at board and bed,
Which cost my purse well favorably.
\endverse
\beginverse
I bought thee petticoats of the best,
The cloth so fine as fine might be;
I gave thee jewels for thy chest,
And all this cost I spent on thee.
\endverse
\beginverse
Thy smock of silk, both fair and white,
With gold embroidered gorgeously,
Thy petticoat of Sendall right,
And this I bought thee gladly.
\endverse
\beginverse
Thy girdle of the gold so red,
With pearls bedecked sumptuously,
The like no other lasses had,
And yet thou wouldst not love me.
\endverse
\beginverse
Thy purse and also thy gay gilt knives,
Thy pincase gallant to the eye;
No better wore the Burgesse wives,
And yet thou wouldst not love me.
\endverse
\beginverse
Thy crimson stockings all of silk,
With gold all wrought above the knee,
Thy pumps as white as was the milk,
And yet thou wouldst not love me.
\endverse
\beginverse
Thy gown was of the glossy green,
Thy sleeves of satin hanging by,
Which made thee be our Harvest Queen,
And yet thou wouldst not love me. 
\endverse
