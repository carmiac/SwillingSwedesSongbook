\beginsong{Long Distance Squire}[by={Galen of Bristol, Genvieve McCullum du Caen},
                     tune = {Cats in the Cradle}]
\beginverse
Squired a lad just the other day
Gave him his belt in the usual way
But there were wars to fight, and men to slay
He made his sword while I was away
And he was fighting 'fore I knew it, and as he grew
He'd say "I'm Going to be like you, Sir
You know I'm going to be like you"
\endverse
\beginchorus
And the cats in the cradle, and the silver spoon
Little Squire boy, and the Man in the Moon
When you coming home, Sir? I don't know when
But we'll get together then, Squire
You know we'll have a good fight then 
\endchorus
\beginverse
He became a lord just the other day
He said "Thanks for the shield, Sir, come on lets play
Can you teach me to kill?" I said "Not today
I got a lot to do." He said "That's okay"
And he walked away, but his smile never dimmed
He said "I'm going to be like him, yeah
You know I'm going to be like him" 
\endverse
\beginverse
He came from Pennsic just the other day
So much like a Knight I just had to say
"Squire I'm proud of you, can you fight for a while?"
He shook his head and he said with a smile
"What I'd really like, Sir, Is to borrow your tent please
See you later, will you leave us in peace?" 
\endverse
\beginverse
He's long been a knight, he's traveled far away
I saw him here just the other day
"I'd like to learn that snap blow, if you don't mind?"
He said "I'd teach you sir if I could find the time
But see the new Crown's a hassle, and the squires are new
But it's been nice sparring with you"
And as the King walked away, it occurred to me
He'd grown up just like me. My Squire was just like me
