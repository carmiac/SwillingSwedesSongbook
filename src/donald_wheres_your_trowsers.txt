\beginsong{Donald, Where's Yuir Trowsers?}[by={Traditional}]
\beginchorus
Let the winds blow high, let the winds blow low
Through the street in me Kilt I go
All the lassies say hello
Donald where's yuir trowsers? 
\endchorus
\beginverse
I just came down from the Isle of Skye
I'm no very big, and I'm awfully shy
The lassies say as I go by
Donald where's yuir trowsers?
\endverse
\beginverse
A lassie took me to a ball
And it was slippery in the hall
And I feared that I might fall
Cause I had on me trowsers!
\endverse
\beginverse
Now I went down to London town
To have some fun on the underground
The lassies turned their heads around
Said, Donald where's yuir trowsers?
\endverse
\beginverse
Ah wearin' the kilt is mighty light
It is not wrong I know it's right
The islanders would get a fright
If they saw me in my trowsers
\endverse
\beginverse
The lassies love me every one
They have to catch me if they can
They can't take the breeks off a Heilan' man
Sayin' Donald where's yuir trowsers? 
\endverse
