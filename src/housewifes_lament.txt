\beginsong{The Housewife’s Lament}[by={Traditional Irish}]
\beginverse
One day I was walking, I heard a complaining,
And saw an old woman, the picture of gloom.
She gazed at the mud on her doorstep ('twas raining).
And this was her song as she wielded her broom: 
\endverse
\beginchorus
Oh, Life is a toil, and love is a trouble,
Beauty will fade and riches'll flee.
Pleasures they dwindle and prices they double,
And nothing is as I would wish it to be.
\endchorus
\beginverse
There's too much of worriement goes to a bonnet,
There's too much ironing goes to a shirt.
There's nothing that pays for the time you waste on it;
There's nothing that lasts us but trouble and dirt.
\endverse
\beginverse
In March it is mud, it is slush In December;
The midsummer breezes are loaded with dust.
In fall the leaves litter. In muddy September
The wallpaper rots and the candlesticks rust.
\endverse
\beginverse
There are worms on the cherries and slugs on the roses,
And ants in the sugar and mice in the pies.
The rubbish of spiders no mortal supposes;
And ravaging roaches and damaging flies.
\endverse
\beginverse
It's sweeping at six and it's dusting at seven.
It's victuals at eight and it's dishes at nine.
It's potting and panning from ten to eleven;
We scarce break our fast till we plan how to dine.
\endverse
\beginverse
With grease and with grime, from corner to center,
Forever at war and forever alert.
No rest for a day lest the enemy enter;
I spend my whole life in struggle with dirt.
\endverse
\beginverse
Last night in my dreams I was stationed forever
On a far little rock in the midst of the sea.
My one chance of life was a ceaseless endeavour
To sweep off the waves as they swept over me.
\endverse
\beginverse
Alas! 'Twas no dream; ahead I behold it.
I see I am helpless my fate to avert.
She lay down her broom, her apron she folded,
She lay down and died and was buried in dirt. 
\endverse
