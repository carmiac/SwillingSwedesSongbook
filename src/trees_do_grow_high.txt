\beginverse
The trees they do grow high, 
And the leaves they do grow green,
But the time is gone and past, my love, 
That you and I have see.
It's a cold winter's night, my love, 
And here I must abide alone.
My bonny lad was young, but a growing.
\endverse
\beginverse
"O, Father, dearest Father, 
I fear you've done me wrong,
For you've married me to a bonny boy, 
But I fear he is too young."
"O, my daughter, dearest daughter, 
If you stay at home a time with me,
A lady you shall be, while he is growing?"
\endverse
\beginverse
"We'll send him to a college,
But for a year or two,
And then perhaps in time, my love, 
Into a man he'll grow.
I will buy you a ribbon blue 
To tie about his bonny waist,
To let the ladies know that he's married."
\endverse
\beginverse
At the age of sixteen, 
He was a married man,
And at the age of seventeen, 
He was father of a son,
And at the age of eighteen, 
His grave it was growing green,
And that did put an end to his growing.
\endverse
\beginverse
She made her love a shroud 
Of the holland, O so fine,
And ev'ry stitch she put in it, 
Her tears came trickling down.
"O, once I had a sweetheart, 
But now I have got never a one,
So fare you well my true love for ever."
\endverse
\beginverse
The trees they do grow high, 
And the leaves they do grow green,
But the time is gone and past, my love, 
That you and I have see.
It's a cold winter's night, my love, 
And here I must abide alone.
My bonny lad was young, but a growing.
