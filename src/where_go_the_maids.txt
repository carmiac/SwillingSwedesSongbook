\beginverse
Where go the maids on summer's day
When the Falcon bears their men away
\endverse
\beginchorus
Sing willow a willow away hey hey
Sing willow a willow away
Sing willow a willow away
\endchorus
\beginverse
Gone to the hall to step a dance
While their good lovers break a lance
\endverse
\beginverse
And drink their mead where it is kept
While their good lovers drink their sweat
\endverse
\beginverse
And trade they kisses with young beaus
While their good husbands trade at blows
\endverse
\beginverse
And when the Falcon comes to nest
They welcome their good men to rest
\endverse
\beginverse
For lords may ken to battle's run
But a lady too will have her fun
\endverse
