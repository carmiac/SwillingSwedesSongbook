\beginverse
I drank 16 doubles for the price of one
Tryin to find the courage to talk to the one
I asked her for a dance, not a second glance
My night had just begun
\endverse
\beginverse
Well I'd drink to the father or the holy ghost
I'm kneeling at the altar of my nightly post
So I'll raise a glass, not the first or last
Come join me in this toast
\endverse
\beginchorus
Because the old black rum's got a hold on me
Like a dog wrapped 'round my leg
And the old black rum's got a hold on me
Will I live for another day(heyyyyy)will I live for another day
\endchorus
\beginverse
Well the queen of George Street just went walkin' on by
Walkin' on by with some guy who don't care
That she stood in line since half past nine
And spent three hours on her hair
  (on her hair!)
\endverse
\beginverse
Her friend is lookin' at me with an evil grin
I think a bloody racket might soon begin
I must have said something to the George Street queen
Her boys are joining in
\endverse
\textnote{Chorus}
\beginverse
So I drank all of my money and I slept out in the rain
Everyday is different, but the nights they're all the same
You never see the sun on the old black rum
But I know I'm gonna do it again
\endverse
\textnote{Chorus x2}
Will I live for another day
\endsong
