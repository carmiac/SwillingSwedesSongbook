\beginverse
Ye Mariners all as ye pass by
Come in and drink if you are dry
Come spend my lads your money brisk
And pop your nose in a jug of this
\endverse
\beginverse
Oh Mariners all as ye part the ground
You're welcome all for to sit down
Come spend my lads your money brisk
And pop your nose in a jug of this
\endverse
\beginverse
Oh Tipplers all as you pass by
Come in and drink if you are dry
Come in and drink, think not amiss
And pop your nose in a jug of this
\endverse
\beginverse
And now I'm old and can scarcely crawl
I've a long grey beard and a head that's bald
From my desire, fulfill my bliss
A pretty girl, and a jug of this
\endverse
\beginverse
And when I'm in my grave and dead
And all my sorrows have past and fled
Transform me then into a fish
And let me swim in a jug of this
\endverse
