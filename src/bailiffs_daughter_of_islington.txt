\beginsong{The Bailiff's Daughter of Islington}[by={Traditional}]
\beginverse
There was a youth and a well beloved youth
And he was a squire’s son;
He loved the bailiff's daughter dear,
That lived in Islington.
\endverse
\beginverse
Yet she was coy and would not believe.
That he did love her so,
No, nor at any time would she
Any countenance to him show.
\endverse
\beginverse
But when his friends did understand,
His fond and foolish mind,
They sent him up to fair London town,
An apprentice for to bind.
\endverse
\beginverse
And when he had been seven long years,
And never his love could see;
"Many a tear have I shed for her sake
When she little thought of me.:
\endverse
\beginverse
Then all the maids of Islington
Went forth to sport and play;
All but the bailiffs daughter dear,
She secretly stole away.
\endverse
\beginverse
She pulled off her gown of green,
And put on some ragged attire;
And to fair London she would go,
Her true love to inquire.
\endverse
\beginverse
And as she went along the high road,
The weather being hot and dry,
She sat her down upon a green bank
And her true love came riding by.
\endverse
\beginverse
She started up with a color so red,
Catching hold of his bridle rein;
"One penny, one penny, kind sir," she said,
"Will ease me of much pain."
\endverse
\beginverse
"Before I give you one penny fair maid,
Pray tell me where you were born."
"At Islington, kind sir," said she,
\endverse
\beginverse
"Where I have had many a scorn.
If that be so, I prithee, fair maid,
Oh, tell me whether you know
The bailiffs daughter of Islington?"
\endverse
\beginverse
"She is dead, sir, long ago."
"If she be dead, then take my horse,
My saddle and bridle also;
For I will into some far country
\endverse
\beginverse
Where no man shall me know.
"oh stay, oh stay, thou goodly youth,
She standeth by thy side;
She is hear alive, she is
And ready to be thy bride."
\endverse
\beginverse
Oh, farewell grief and welcome joy
Ten thousand times therefore;
For now I have found my own true love,
Whom I tho’t I never should see more." 
\endverse
