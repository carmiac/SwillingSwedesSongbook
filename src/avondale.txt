\beginsong{Avondale}[by={Dominic Behan}]
\beginchorus
Oh have you been to Avondale
And wandered in the lovely vale
Where tall trees whisper all the tale
Of Avondale's proud eagle 
\endchorus
\beginverse
Where fame and ancient glory fate
Such was the land where he was laid
Like Christ was thirty pieces paid
For Avondale's proud eagle 
\endverse
\beginverse
Long years that green and lovely vale
Has nursed Parnell, our grandest Gael
And cursed the land that has betrayed
Fair Avondale's proud eagle 
\endverse
