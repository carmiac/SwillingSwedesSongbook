\beginsong{Dear Lord}
\beginverse
Dear lord, I send this note to you, to tell you of my plight
for at the time of writing, I am not a pretty sight.
My body is all black and blue, my face a deathly grey
and I send this note to say, why I'm not at work today
\endverse
\beginverse
Whilst working on the castle wall, some stones I had to clear
to throw them down from such a height, was not a good idea.
The overseer wasn't pleased, the bloody awkward sod
and he said I'd have to cart them down the ladders in my hod.
\endverse
\beginverse
Now clearing all these stones by hand, it was so very slow
so I hoisted up a barrel and secured a rope below.
But in my haste to do the job, I was to blind to see
that a barrel full of building stones was heavier than me.
\endverse
\beginverse
And so, when I untied the rope, the barrel fell like lead
and clinging tightly to the rope I started up instead!
I shot up like an eagle 'til to my dismay I found
that halfway up I met the bloody barrel coming down!
\endverse
\beginverse
The barrel broke my shoulder, as toward the ground it sped
and when I reached the top I banged the pulley with my head. 
I hung on tightly, numb from shock from this almighty blow
and the barrel spilled out half the stones some thirty feet below.
\endverse
\beginverse
Now when those stones had fallen from the barrel to the floor
I then outweighed the barrel and so started down once more.
Still clinging tightly to the rope, my body racked with pain
when, halfway down, I met the bloody barrel coming once again.
\endverse
\beginverse
The force of this collision, halfway up the castle block
caused multiple abrasions and a nasty state of shock.
Still clinging tightly to the rope I fell towards the ground
and I landed on the building stones the barrel scattered round.
\endverse
\beginverse
I lay there groaning on the ground, I thought I'd passed the worse
but the barrel hit the pulley-wheel and then the bottom burst.
A shower of stones rained down on me, I hadn't got a hope
as I lay there bleeding on the ground. I let go the bloody rope!
\endverse
\beginverse
The barrel was free to fall and down it came once more
and landed right across me, as I lay upon the floor.
It broke three ribs and my left arm and I can only say
that I hope you understand why I'm not at work today! 
\endverse
