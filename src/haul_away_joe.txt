\beginverse
When I was a little boy,
so me mother told me, Tammy.
Way haul away, we'll haul away Joe.
\endverse
\beginverse
That if I did not kiss the girls,
my lips would all grow moldy Tammy
Way haul away, we'll haul away Joe.
\endverse

Now way haul away, the good ship now is rolling Tammy
Way haul away, we'll haul away Joe.
\endverse
\beginverse
King Louis was the king of France,
before the rev-o-lu-shy-ann
Way haul away, we'll haul away Joe.
\endverse
\beginverse
And then he got his head cut off,
it spoiled his-con-sti-tu-shy-ann.
Way haul away, we'll haul away Joe.
\endverse
\beginverse
Now first I met a Yankee girl
and she was fat and lazy, Tammy
Way haul away, we'll haul away Joe.
\endverse
\beginverse
And then I met an irish girl,
she damn near drove me crazy
Way haul away, we'll haul away Joe.
\endverse
\beginverse
Now way haul away, we're bound for better weather Tammy.
Way haul away, we'll haul away Joe.
