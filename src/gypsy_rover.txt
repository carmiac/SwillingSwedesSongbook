\beginsong{Gypsy Rover}[by={Traditional}]
\beginverse
The gypsy rover came over the hill,
Bound through the valley so shady;
He whistled and he sang till the green woods rang,
And he won the heart of a lady. 
\endverse
\beginchorus
Lah-Dee-o, Lah-Dee-O-ah-day,
Lay-dee-o, Lah dee ay dee.
He whistled and he sang until the green woods rang,
And he won the heart of a lady. 
\textnote{Each chorus follows similarly}
\endchorus
\beginverse
She left her father's castle gate,
She left her own true lover;
She left her servants and her estate,
To follow the gypsy rover. 
\endverse
\beginverse
Her father saddled his fastest steed,
He roam'd the valley all over;
He sought his daughter at great speed,
And the whistling gypsy rover. 
\endverse
\beginverse
He came at last to a mansion fine,
Down by the river Claydee;
And there was music, and there was wine,
For the gypsy and his lady. 
\endverse
\beginverse
"O, father he's no gypsy free,
But lord of these lands all over;
And I will stay till my dying day,
With my whistling gypsy rover."
