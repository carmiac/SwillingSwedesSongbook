\beginverse
Seven days before 12th Night my true love bade of me,
"Make me a tabard that is red and yellow parti"
\endverse
\beginverse
Six days before 12th Night my true love bade of me,
"Pray make a banner just like the tabard that is red and yellow parti"
\endverse
\beginverse
Five days before 12th Night my daughter came to me,
"Make me a corset, don't forget the banner, just like the tabard that is
Red and yellow parti"
\endverse
\beginverse
Four days before 12th Night my son asked of me,
"Make me a tunic, finish my corset, hurry with the banner, that is just
Like the tabard that is red and yellow parti"
\endverse
\beginverse
Three days before 12th Night my best friend bade of me,
"I need 5 gates of hell! Before you do the tunic, after you finish the
corset, while you make the banner that is just like the tabard that is
red and yellow parti"
\endverse
\beginverse
Two days before 12th Night my neighbor asked of me,
"One dagged sleeved hupalon, 2 linen wimples, 5 gates of Hell!, when you
do the tunic, after the corset, when you finish the banner that is just
like the tabard, that is red and yellow parti"
\endverse
\beginverse
On the day of 12th Night my sister bade of me,
"A 4 layer velvet Tudor, after you start the dagged sleeved hupalon, I'll
take over the wimples, almost done on the 5 gates of Hell, forget about
the tunic, but finish up the corset, don't forget the banner that is just
like the tabard that is red and yellow parti"
\endverse
\beginverse
\textnote{SING SLOW AND DIRGE LIKE}
On the day after 12th Night- there was 1 velvet Tudor, 1 dagged
sleeved hupalon, 2 linen wimples, 5 gates of Hell!, 1 full length tunic,
a steel boned corset, 1 thread bare banner just like the tabard that all
ended up in Gold Key!
