\beginchorus
On the fields of black and gold far beneath the mountains high
Where the air is biting cold 'neath the wild, white winter sky
Where the fairest and the bold from the days that were thought gone
Are on the fields of black and gold, on the fields of al-Barran
\endchorus
\beginverse
There in the hall the fire is burning
There in the hall the people sing
The feast is laid out and the night is turning
Hearken to the sound of the Tynkers ...dancing
To the beat of the doumbek drum
As it echoes through the autumn night
Ah, the people know where the music goes
On the fields of black and gold
\endverse
\beginchorus
On the fields of black and gold far beneath the mountains high
Where the air is sharp and clean 'neath the warming springtime sky
Where the fairest and the bold from the days that were thought gone
Are on the fields of black and gold, on the fields of al-Barran
\endchorus
\beginverse
There from the west is the war-drum sounding
Raised is the banner of our king
Here on the fields no man is doubting
Hearken to the sound of the shield wall... marching
To the beat of the Baron's word
His smile is bright and cold
For the Baron knows where the war-drums go
Are the spears of black and gold
\endverse
\beginchorus
On the fields of black and gold far beneath the mountains high
Where the air is dry and hot 'neath a copper summer sky
Where the fairest and the bold from the days that were thought gone
Are on the fields of black and gold, on the fields of al-Barran
\endchorus
\beginverse
There is the man all dressed in Crimson
Strong of arm and keen of sight
There is the man in black and silver
Bathed in the glow of Martin's...holy light
And the man of steel and blood
Sing hail to the brotherhood
Ah, the people know where the warriors go
On the fields of black and gold
\endverse
\beginchorus
\textnote{Slowly}
On the fields of black and gold far beneath the mountains high
Where the air is biting cold 'neath the wild, white, winter sky
Where the fairest and the bold from the days that were thought gone
Are on the fields of black and gold, on the fields of al-Barran
\endchorus
