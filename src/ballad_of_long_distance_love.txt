\beginverse
Oh my lady is fair as the morning
My lady is sweet as the dew
But my lady dwells in far Atlantia
So I'll sleep at Estrella with you
\endverse
\beginverse
Oh her smile is as bright as the sunrise
And her voice like a nightingale's song
I would fly to her side in an instant
If the journey were not quite so long
\endverse
\beginverse
Oh my lady is gentle and lovely
Thoughts of her warm my heart, it is true
But my lady's not here at Outlandish
So I'll dance by the fire for you
\endverse
\beginverse
Oh her laughter is like sweetest music
And her green eyes like emeralds shine bright
I am certain that she will be grateful
That you kept me from freezing last night
\endverse
\beginverse
Oh my lady is surely an angel
Twas pure torture to bid her adieu
But she could not fly her to this mountain
So I'll go to the hot springs with you
\endverse
\beginverse
Oh I carry her favor in battle
For her honor I gladly would die
But if she can't make it to Pennsic
I'm not gonna sit down and cry
\endverse
\beginverse
Oh my lady is fair as the morning
With a voice like a nightingale's song
I would fly to her side in an instant
If the journey were not quite so long
\endverse
