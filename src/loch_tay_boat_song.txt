\beginsong{Loch Tay Boat Song}[by={Scottish Traditional}]
\beginverse
When I'm done the work of day
And I row my boat away
Dawn the waters of Loch Tay
When the evening light is fallen
\endverse
\beginverse
Then I look towards Ben Lass
Where the after glories glow
And I dream of two bright eyes
Where the Mary Mirth glow
\endverse
\beginverse
She's my beauteous Maiden Loch
She's my Joy and Sorrow too
Though I own she is not true
Ah, but I cannot live without her
\endverse
\beginverse
For my heart's a boat in two
And I'd give the world to know
If she means to let me go
As I send me slowly home
\endverse
\beginverse
And in Loch her loving hair
Has more beauty I declare
Then all the tresses fair
From Cildain to Aber Felde
\endverse
\beginverse
Be they lent, white, gold, or brown
Be they blacker than the sloe
They meant not as much to me
As a meltin' flake of snow
\endverse
\beginverse
And her dance is like the gleam
Of the sunlight on the stream
And the songs that we folk sing
Oh they're songs that she sings milkin'
\endverse
\beginverse
But my heart is full of woe
For last night she bade me go
And the tears began to flow
As I silently go home 
\endverse
\beginverse
When I'm done the work of day
And I row my boat away
Dawn the waters of Loch Tay
When the evening light is fallen
\endverse
