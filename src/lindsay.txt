\beginsong{Lindsay}
\beginverse
Now Lindsay he has taken to the road, straight to the North he'll steer
With his face and a fiddle in his pack, he'll make a living its clear
He's well met with a peddler group, and a chance to a chance at the Inn
He' called to the rail, and he's taken the fife, and he's careful to stick to the tune
\endverse
\beginverse
Now all through the night they fiddle and fife, for the dancers have taken to the floor
They neither one took a pipe or a glass, or a lass while the music was on
They played up through the markets and fairs, till a glance to the north they've come
And there they met Black Janet De'Willie, who sang as she rattled a drum
\endverse
\beginverse
Now Lindsay's asked Black Janet to dance, and ye never saw so bonny a pair
She has taken him firm by the hand, and she's kicked to the top of the stair
"Here" she said "is a fine feather bed, where a man be weary or creel
May step for me against Strathspey, Wi' me lute and the tune in his ears
\endverse
\beginverse
Now Janet was as good as her word, Lindsay has proven his worth
May ye all have so merry a dance if ever ye come to the north
\endverse
\beginverse
Now Lindsay he has taken to the road, straight to the Northhill still
With his face and a fiddle in his pack, he'll make a living its clear
He's well met with a peddler group, and a chance to a chance at the Inn
He' called to the rail, and he's taken the fife, and he's careful to stick to the tune
