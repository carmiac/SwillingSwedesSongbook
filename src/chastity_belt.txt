\beginsong{The Chastity Belt}[by={Modern Traditional}]
\beginverse
Pray gentile maiden, may I be your lover?
Condemn me no longer to wail and to weep
Cut like a heart, I lie wounded and fainting
Let down the drawbridge, I'll enter your Keep
\endverse
\beginchorus
Enter you nonny, nonny
Enter you nonny, nonny
Let down the drawbridge, I'll enter your Keep
\endchorus
\beginverse
Alas Sir I cannot, I am not a maiden
Married I am to a cunning old Celt
He's off to the wars for 12 month or longer
He has the Key to my Chastity Belt
\endverse
\beginchorus
He has my Key, Nonny, Nonny
Oh, Woe is Me, Nonny, Nonny
He has the Key to my Chastity Belt
\endchorus
\beginverse
Fear not Gentle Maiden, for I know a Blacksmith
Let us go then and knock on his door
(Knock, Knock)
Availing ourselves of his specialized knowledge
We'll see if he is able to unpick your lock
\endverse
\beginchorus
Unpick your lock Nonny, Nonny
Unpick your lock Nonny, Nonny
See if he's able to unpick your lock
\endchorus
\beginverse
Alas Sir, and Ma'am, to help I'm unable
My technical knowledge is of no avail
I cannot find the secret of its combination
The cunning old bastard has fitted a Yale
\endverse
\beginchorus
Fitted a Yale Nonny, Nonny
Fitted a Yale Nonny, Nonny
The cunning old bastard has fitted a Yale
\endchorus
\beginverse
Then up came the page with news of disaster
Your lordship is no longer with us, he cried
As we were passing the Straights of Gibraltar
Your lord... And your Key... They went... Over... The side
\endverse
\beginchorus
Over the side Nonny, Nonny
Over the side Nonny, Nonny
I do not care about him, I WANT MY KEY
\endchorus
\beginverse
Alas cried the maid I am locked up forever
Then up stepped the Blacksmith and said he with glee
'Twas I forged your belt, I made the key also
And as a precaution, I have made copies three
One for your lord, and one for the High Priest
But only one works, and that is kept for me
\endverse
\beginchorus
Copies made three Nonny, Nonny
I have your Key Nonny, Nonny
Only one works, and that I kept for me.... 
\endchorus
