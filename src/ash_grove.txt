\beginsong{The Ash Grove}[by={Traditional}]
\beginverse
Down yonder green valley where streamlets meander,
When twilight is fading I pensively rove,
Or at the bright noontide in solitude wander
Amid the dark shades of the lonely ash grove.
\endverse
\beginverse
'Tis there where the blackbird is cheerfully singing
Each warbler enchants with his note from the tree
Ah, then little think I of sorrow or sadness
The ash grove enchanting, spells beauty for me.
\endverse
\beginverse
The ash grove, how graceful, how plainly 'tis speaking
The harp through it playing has language for me
Whenever the light through its branches is breaking
A host of kind faces is gazing on me;
\endverse
\beginverse
The friends of my childhood again are before me
Each step wakes a memory as freely I roam;
With soft whispers laden it's leaves rustle o'er me,
The ash grove, the ash grove, alone is my home.
\endverse
\beginverse
My laughter is over, my step loses lightness,
Old countryside measures fall soft on my ear.
Whenever I think on the past and its brightness,
The dear ones I mourn for again gather here.
\endverse
\beginverse
From out of the shadows their loving looks greet me.
And wistfully searching the leafy green dome,
I find other faces, fond, bending to greet me.
The ash grove, the ash grove, alone is my home. 
\endverse
