\beginverse
Now, I am a dragon, please listen to me
For I'm misunderstood to a dreadful degree;
This ecology needs me and I know me place,
But I'm fighting extinction with all of my race.
\endverse
\beginverse
Oh, I came to this village to better my health
Which is shockingly poor despite all my wealth,
But I get no assistance and no sympathy,
Just impertinent questioning shouted at me.
\endverse
\beginchorus
Yes, virgins taste better than those who are not,
But my favorite snack food with peril is fraught:
For my teeth will decay and my trim go to pot;
Yes, virgins taste better than those who are not.
\endchorus
\beginverse
Well, I'm really quite kind almost all through the year
Vegetarian ways are now mine out of fear,
But a birthday needs sweets as I'm sure you'll agree
And barbecued wench tastes like candy to me.
\endverse
\beginverse
As it happens our interests are almost the same.
You see I'm really quite skilful at managing game.
If I ate just your men, would your excess decline?
Of course not, the rest would just make better time.
\endverse
\beginchorus
Yes, virgins taste better than those who are not,
But my favorite snack food with peril is fraught:
For my teeth will decay and my trim go to pot;
Yes, virgins taste better than those who are not.
\endchorus
\beginverse
Now, the number of babies a woman can bear
Has limits and that's why my pruning's done there.
Yet an orphan's a sad sight and so when I munch
I'm careful to eat only virgins for lunch 
\endverse
