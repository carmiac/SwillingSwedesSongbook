\beginverse
As I was going to the Faire of Dingle, 
One fine morning last July, 
And walking down the road before me, 
A red-haired girl I chanced to spy. 
\endverse
\beginverse
Come ride with me, my red-hair maiden, 
My donkey, he can carry two. 
She looked at me, her eyes a-twinklin' 
And her cheeks a rosy hue. 
\endverse
\beginchorus 
Keep your hands off Red Haired Mary, 
Her and I will soon be wed. 
We'll see a priest this very morning, 
Tonight we'll lie in a marriage bed. 
\endchorus
\beginverse
Now when we reached the town of Dingle, 
I took her hand to say goodbye. 
When a tinker, he stepped up beside me, 
And belted me in my left eye. 
\endverse
\beginverse
Well I was feelin kinda peevish, 
My poor old eye felt sad and sore, 
When I tapped him gently with my hobnails 
And he flew back to Murphy's door. 
\endverse
\beginverse
Well he galloped off to find his brothers, 
The tallest men I e'er did meet, 
When he tapped me gently with his knuckles, 
And I was minus two front teeth. 
\endverse
\beginverse
Now a pealer, he came round the corner, 
Said, "Young man, you done broke the law." 
When my donkey kicked him in the kneecaps 
And he fell down and broke his jaw. 
\endverse
\beginverse
Well the red hair girl, she kept a'smiling, 
"Young man, I'll come with you," she said. 
We'll forget the priest this very morning, 
Tonight we'll lie in Murphy's shed. 
\endverse
