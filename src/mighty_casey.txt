\beginsong{Mighty Casey}[by={Edmound Bernhard }]
\beginverse
The field was terribly vicious
For the tourney list that day
A Baby Knight from Ansteorra
Seemed poised to have his way
\endverse
\beginverse
So when Jago was one-shotted
And Bertrond had lost both arms
A mood of deep depression
Fell over the Outlands Charms
\endverse
\beginverse
The lesser fighters bereft of lives
Made way back to the camp
But the older Outlands fighters
Would stay to see the champ
\endverse
\beginverse
They said "If only Casey
Had had a chance to fight
We'd have a chance to win our luck
Against this Rhino-Hide
\endverse
\beginverse
Then suddenly their eyes lit up
A cry rose from their Lords
It echoed off the polearms
It rattled off the swords
\endverse
\beginverse
It rumbled through the valley
Where Outlandish fighters healed
For Casey, Mighty Casey
Was about to take the field
\endverse
\beginverse
His helm was brightly shining
His leathers richly tanned
His breastplate layered titanium
(Which cost him half a grand)
\endverse
\beginverse
The shield upon his mighty arm
Was golden from afar
Between his teeth he coolly clenched
A really good cigar
\endverse
\beginverse
The Outlands fighters now revived
Together in one light
Would cheer the mighty Casey on
In this, his greatest fight
\endverse
\beginverse
There was ease in Casey's manner
As his new opponent met
His hands were steady as a rock
His brow was free of sweat
\endverse
\beginverse
"One quick blow" he murmured
As he looked up to the sky
Then bowing only to his Queen
He launched into the fight
\endverse
\beginverse
The cool is drained from Casey's face
His eyes are hard and keen
And all along his sun-drenched brow
Great furrows can be seen
\endverse
\beginverse
And now he calmly grips his sword
And now he makes his throw
And Now The Air Is SHATTERED
By the force of Casey's blow
\endverse
\beginverse
Oh somewhere in the Knowne Worlde
There is a Happy Place
Where Gentle Lords and Ladies
Lie oblivious in their grace
\endverse
\beginverse
But there is no joy in the Outlands
Upon this sultry night
For the foe of Mighty Casey
Has called his great blow "Light" 
\endverse
