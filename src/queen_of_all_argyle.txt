\beginsong{The Queen of Argyll}[by={Andy~Stewart}]
\beginverse
Gentlemen, it is my duty to inform you of one beauty
Though I'd ask of you a favor, no to seek her for a while
I own she is a creature of character and feature
No words can paint the picture of the Queen of all Argyll! 
\endverse
\beginchorus
And if you could have seen her there!
Boys, if you had just been there!
The swan was in her movement and the morning in her smile
All the roses in the garden they bow and ask her pardon
For not one could match the beauty of the Queen of all Argyll! 
\endchorus
\beginverse
On the evening that I mentioned, I passed with light intention
thru a part of our dear country known for beauty and for style
Bein' a place of noble thinkers, of scholars and great drinkers
But above them all for splendor shone the Queen of all Argyll! 
\endverse
\beginverse
So, m'lads I needs must leave you, my intention's not to grieve you
Nor indeed would I deceive you, no, I'll see you in a while
I must find some way to gain her, to court her and to tame her
I fear my heart's in danger from the Queen of all Argyll! 
\endverse
