\beginsong{Golden, Golden}[by={Andy~Stewart}]
\beginverse
Slowly, slowly, walk the path,
And you might never stumble or fall
Slowly, slowly walk the path,
And you might never find love at all 
\endverse
\beginchorus
Golden golden is her hair
Like the mornin' sun, o'er the fields of corn
Golden, golden flows her love,
So sweet, and clean, and warm 
\endchorus
\beginverse
Lonely, lonely, is the heart
That ne'er another can call it's own
Lonely, lonely is the heart
That has to live all alone 
\endverse
\beginverse
Wildly, wildly, beats the heart
With a rush of love like a mountain stream
Wildly, wildly, play your part
As free as a wild bird dreams 
\endverse
