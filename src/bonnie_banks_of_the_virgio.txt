\beginsong{Bonnie Bonnie Banks of the Virgio}[by={Traditional}]

Three sisters walked out one fine day,
All the lee and the lonely-o,
Met a robber on the way,
On the bonnie, bonnie banks of the Virgio.
\endverse
\textnote{Repeat "All the lee..." and "On the bonnie..." in each verse}
\beginverse
He took the first one by the hand,
All the lee and the lonely-o,
He whipped her 'round and he made her stand,
On the bonnie, bonnie banks of the Virgio.
\endverse
\textnote{Similarly}
\beginverse
Oh, will you be a robber's wife,
Or will you die by my pen-knife,

And so I'll die by your pen-knife,

And there he took her own dear life,

And I'll not die by your pen-knife.

For you have killed my sisters dear,
You would na' have done that if me brother was here,
\endverse

Oh, tell me what does your brother do,
Why, he's a robber just like you.

Oh, my God, what have I done,
I've killed my sisters, all save one,

And so he took his wee pen-knife,
And there he took his own dear life,
