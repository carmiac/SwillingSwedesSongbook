\beginsong{The Mongol Song}[by={Modern Traditional}]
\beginverse
When I was a young girl, and very protected
I thought that a Mongol was to be decried
But now I am older and I have different values
And I've learned that a Mongol cannot be denied
\endverse
\beginverse
And I say to myself, this is not what I planned
All this burning and looting, and pillaging towns
I might have been Queen, but things turned out different
And if you've got knives you've no need for a Crown
\endverse
\beginverse
One day as I went walking alone by the river
I came on a Mongol who there changed my life
He had me, I had him, and we had each other
I bore him a son, and he took me to wife (in that order!)
\endverse
\beginverse
And I say to myself, as I dress for the wars
In my leathers and furs, with my braids hanging down
My life may be strange, but its never been boring
And if you've got knives, you've no need for a Crown
\endverse
