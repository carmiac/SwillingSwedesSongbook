\beginsong{Girl I Left Behind Me}
\beginverse
Come all ye handsome comely maids
That live near Carlow dwelling
Beware of young men's flatt'ring tongue
When love to you they' re telling.
Beware of the kind words they say,
Be wise and do not mind them,
For if they were talking till they die
They' d leave you all behind them.
\endverse
\beginverse
In Carlow town I lived I own
All free from dept and danger.
Till Colonel Reilly listed me
To join the Wicklow Rangers.
They dressed me up in scarlet red
And they used me very kindly
But still I thought my heart would bread
For the girl I left behind me.
\endverse
\beginverse
I was scarcely fourteen years of age
When I was broken hearted,
For I' m in love these two long years
Since from my love I parted.
These maidens wonder how I moan
And bid me not to mind him
That he might have more grief than joy
For leaving me behind him. 
\endverse
