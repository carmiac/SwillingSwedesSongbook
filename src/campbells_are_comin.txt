\beginchorus
The Campbell's are comin, Oho! Oho!
The Campbell's are comin, Oho! Oho!
The Campbell's are comin to bonnie Lochleven,
The Campbell's are comin Oho! Oho!
\endchorus
\beginverse
Upon the Lomonds I lay, I lay,
Upon the Lomonds I lay, I lay,
I looked down to bonnie Lochleven,
And saw three bonnie perches play
\endverse
\beginverse
Great Argyle he goes before,
He makes his cannons and guns to roar,
Wi' sound o trumpet, pipe and drum
The Campbell's are comin Oho, Oho!
\endverse
\beginverse
The Campbell's they are a'in arms
Their loyal faith and truth to show,
Wi banners rattling in the wind
The Campbell's are comin Oho, Oho!
