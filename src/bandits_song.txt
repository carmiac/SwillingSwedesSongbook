\beginverse
From this valley they say you are leaving
We will miss your bright swords and strong arms
For they say you are taking as plunder
All the food we have stored in our barns
\endverse
\beginverse
Oh leave us some things for the winter
Take not all we implore with a sob
Or when you return in the springtime
You will not find a peasant to rob
\endverse
\beginverse
You have gotten our dear daughters pregnant
You have cut up our cows for your stew
Oh we hired you for our protection
But we needed protection from you 
\endverse
