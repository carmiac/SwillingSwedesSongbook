\beginsong{Metamorphosis}
\beginverse
As I went out one morning, morning so fair,
I met a lovely maiden with flaxen hair.
I知 going to see her Sunday, my love to declare
And win unnumbered kisses from lips so rare.
\endverse
\beginchorus
J誕i fait une mai tresse, ya pas long temps,
J誕irai la voir di
Manche sans plus tarder,
Je pren drai sur sa bouche un doux baiser.
\endchorus
\beginverse
(She) Young man, before you kiss me, try as you will,
Young man, before you kiss me, try as you will,
I shall become a wild doe and run up the hill,
Because I do not like you and never will.
\endverse
\beginverse
(He) If you become a doe and flee 祖ross the plain,
If you become a doe and flee 祖ross the plain,
Then I値l become a hunter, and fetch you back again,
For parted from your sweetness I値l not remain.
\endverse
\beginverse
(She) If you become a hunter, I値l rove about.
If you become a hunter, I値l rove about.
I値l jump into the river and then be a trout,
And down among the rocks I値l swim in and out.
\endverse
\beginverse
(He) If you become a trout, an angler I値l be,
If you become a trout, an angler I値l be,
I値l cast my line and catch you where stream meets the sea,
For no one else shall have you, no one but me.
\endverse
\beginverse
(She) If you become an angler, casting my way,
If you become an angler, casting my way,
Then I値l become a rose and in my garden stay,
Because my answer to you shall e弾r be nay.
\endverse
\beginverse
(He) If you become a rosebud, glist地ing with dew,
If you become a rosebud, glist地ing with dew,
Then I値l become a gard地er and when I find you,
I値l let no one come near, 奏ill to me you池e true.
\endverse
\beginverse
(She) If you become a gard地er, I知 not undone,
If you become a gard地er, I知 not undone,
I値l climb right o弾r the convent wall and then be a nun,
For I will grant no favors to you, not one.
\endverse
\beginverse
(He) If you become a nun, behind cloistered walls,
If you become a nun, behind cloistered walls,
Then I値l become the doctor who on the cloister calls,
For I shall never lose you, what e弾r befalls.
\endverse
\beginverse
(She) If you become the doctor, then I shall die,
If you become the doctor, then I shall die,
I値l ask the Lord to take me to my home on high,
And then to you at last I値l have said, "Goodbye."
\endverse
\beginverse
(He) If you go up to heaven, I値l race you there,
If you go up to heaven, I値l race you there,
I shall become St. Peter, your home to prepare,
And, for eternity, we, the bliss, will share.
\endverse
\beginverse
(She) Oh, if you are St. Peter, with golden key,
Oh, if you are St. Peter, with golden key
Then I値l come down to earth again and say, "Marry me."
For I have never seen such persistency.
\endverse
