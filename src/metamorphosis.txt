\beginsong{Metamorphosis}
\beginverse
As I went out one morning, morning so fair,
I met a lovely maiden with flaxen hair.
I'm going to see her Sunday, my love to declare
And win unnumbered kisses from lips so rare.
\endverse
\beginchorus
J’ai fait une mai tresse, ya pas long temps,
J’airai la voir di
Manche sans plus tarder,
Je pren drai sur sa bouche un doux baiser.
\endchorus
\beginverse
(She) Young man, before you kiss me, try as you will,
Young man, before you kiss me, try as you will,
I shall become a wild doe and run up the hill,
Because I do not like you and never will.
\endverse
\beginverse
(He) If you become a doe and flee 'cross the plain,
If you become a doe and flee 'cross the plain,
Then I'll become a hunter, and fetch you back again,
For parted from your sweetness I'll not remain.
\endverse
\beginverse
(She) If you become a hunter, I'll rove about.
If you become a hunter, I'll rove about.
I'll jump into the river and then be a trout,
And down among the rocks I'll swim in and out.
\endverse
\beginverse
(He) If you become a trout, an angler I'll be,
If you become a trout, an angler I'll be,
I'll cast my line and catch you where stream meets the sea,
For no one else shall have you, no one but me.
\endverse
\beginverse
(She) If you become an angler, casting my way,
If you become an angler, casting my way,
Then I'll become a rose and in my garden stay,
Because my answer to you shall ev'r be nay.
\endverse
\beginverse
(He) If you become a rosebud, glist'ning with dew,
If you become a rosebud, glist'ning with dew,
Then I'll become a gard'ner and when I find you,
I'll let no one come near, 'till to me you're true.
\endverse
\beginverse
(She) If you become a gard'ner, I'll not undone,
If you become a gard'ner, I'll not undone,
I'll climb right ov'r the convent wall and then be a nun,
For I will grant no favors to you, not one.
\endverse
\beginverse
(He) If you become a nun, behind cloistered walls,
If you become a nun, behind cloistered walls,
Then I'll become the doctor who on the cloister calls,
For I shall never lose you, what ev'r befalls.
\endverse
\beginverse
(She) If you become the doctor, then I shall die,
If you become the doctor, then I shall die,
I'll ask the Lord to take me to my home on high,
And then to you at last I'll have said, "Goodbye."
\endverse
\beginverse
(He) If you go up to heaven, I'll race you there,
If you go up to heaven, I'll race you there,
I shall become St. Peter, your home to prepare,
And, for eternity, we, the bliss, will share.
\endverse
\beginverse
(She) Oh, if you are St. Peter, with golden key,
Oh, if you are St. Peter, with golden key
Then I'll come down to earth again and say, "Marry me."
For I have never seen such persistency.
