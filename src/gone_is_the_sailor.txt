\beginsong{Gone is the Sailor}[by={Ivor~Cutler}]
\beginverse
Home is the sailor, home from the docks
Bringing home the groceries, and the smell of tar 
\endverse
\beginverse
Why does the sailor smell of tar, he doesn't drink the bloody stuff?
Life is full of mysteries, and this is one
\endverse
\beginverse
The sailor is a worried man like everybody else
Bringing in the washing, and the smell of tar
\endverse
\beginverse
When does the sailor sail his boat, we never see him doing it?
Life is full of mysteries, and this is two
\endverse
\beginverse
Gone is the sailor, gone to the pub
Ordering a bag of crisps, and a tot of rum
\endverse
\beginverse
Why does the sailor order a bag of crisps, his shaky fingers cannot tear it open
I've sung about the sailor, and now I'm done
\endverse
\beginverse
Except to sing
Why does the sailor smell of tar, he doesn't drink the bloody stuff....
