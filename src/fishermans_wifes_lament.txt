\beginsong{The Fisherman's Wife's Lament}[by={Traditional},
                     index = {Lament For The Fisherman's Wife}]
\beginverse
By the storm-torn shoreline a woman is standing
The spray strung like jewels in her hair
And the sea tore the rocks near the desolate landing
as though it had known she stood there
\endverse
\beginchorus
Now she had come down to condemn that wild ocean
For the murderous loss of her man
His boat sailed out on Wednesday morning
And it's feared she's gone down with all hands
\endchorus
\beginverse
Oh and white were the wave-caps
And wild was their parting
So fierce is the warring of love
But she prayed to the gods
Both of men and of sailors
Not to cast their cruel nets o'er her love
\endverse
\beginverse
There's a school on the hill
Where the sons of dead fathers
Are led toward tempests and gales
Where their God-given wings
Are clipped close to their bodies
And their eyes are bound-'round with ships' sails
\endverse
\beginverse
What force leads a man
To a life filled with danger
High on seas or a mile underground?
It's when need is his master
And poverty's no stranger
And there's no other work to be found
\endverse
