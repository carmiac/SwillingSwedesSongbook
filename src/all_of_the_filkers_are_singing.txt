\beginsong{All of the Filkers are Singing}[
                     tune = {Greensleeves-ish},
                     ]
\beginverse
The folks have all gathered under the bright moonlight
To sing strange tales of dragons in flight
The laurels overheard us, they've retired for the night
They can't take the sound of our singing 
\endverse
\beginchorus
So belt out whatever note suits you
Join in everyone, is your own key
It's fare thee well, to all vestige of harmony
When all of the filkers are singing 
\endchorus
\beginverse
When sing-a-longs start in this gathering of friends
The authentic mavens scream, "Dear God when will it end"
The drunks and the tone deaf add spice to the blend
Of what we have the gall to call singing 
\endverse
\beginverse
Our bloodshot eyes clash with the pink morning sun
It's a hell of a night once the singing's begun
Yet for some strange reason we claim that it's fun
When everyone is gathered for singing 
\endverse
