\beginsong{The Kings Sailor}[by={Traditional}]
\beginverse
Early early in the spring
I shipped on board to serve my king
I left my dearest, my dear behind
She oft times swore, that her heart was mine
\endverse
\beginverse
Now all the time that sailed the seas
I could not find a moments ease
For thinking of my dearest dear
But never a word of my love did hear
\endverse
\beginverse
At last I sailed into Glasgow town
I searched the streets, both up and down
Inquiring for my dearest dear
But never a word of love did hear
\endverse
\beginverse
I went straight way to her fathers hall
And loudly for my love did call
He said she's married now, she's a rich mans wife
Went to another, for a better full life
\endverse
\beginverse
Well curse you both, curse the sinder truth
And curse the girl, that won't prove true
And the followers, who did break
Who went to another, for riches sake
\endverse
\beginverse
But the girl is married, the tide is come
And I will stay, on land no more
I'll sail the seas, till the day I die
Breaking through the waves, rolling mountain high
\endverse
\beginverse
Early early in the spring
I shipped onboard, to serve my king
I left my dearest, my dear behind
She oft time swore that her heart was mine
\endverse
