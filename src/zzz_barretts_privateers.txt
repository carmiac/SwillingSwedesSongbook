\beginverse
Oh, the year was 1778,
    ("How I wish I was in Sherbrook now!")
A letter of mark came from the King
To the scummiest vessel I've ever seen. 
\endverse
\beginchorus
God damn them all!
I was told we'd cruise the seas for American gold
We'd fire no guns, shed no tears.
Now I'm a broken man on a Halifax Peer, 
The last of Barrett's Privateers.
\endchorus
\beginverse
Oh, Elcid Barrett cried the town
    ("How I wish I was in Sherbrook now!")
For twenty brave soul all fisherman who
Would make for him the "Antelope's" crew
\endverse
\beginverse
The "Antelopes" sloop was a sickening sight
    ("How I wish I was in Sherbrook now!")
She had a list to the port and her sails in rags
And the cook in the scuppers with the staggers and jags
\endverse
\beginverse
On the king's birthday we set to sea
    ("How I wish I was in Sherbrook now!")
It was ninety one days to Montigo Bay
Pumping like madmen all the way
\endverse
\beginverse
On the ninety sixth day we sailed again
    ("How I wish I was in Sherbrook now!")
When a bloody great Yankee hove in sight
With our cracked four-pounders we made to fight.
\endverse
\beginverse
Oh, the Yankee lay low down with gold
    ("How I wish I was in Sherbrook now!")
She was broad and fat and loose in stays
But to catch her took the Antelope two whole days.
\endverse
\beginverse
Then at length we stood two cables away
    ("How I wish I was in Sherbrook now!")
Our cracked four-pounders made an awful din
But with one fat ball the Yank stove us in
\endverse
\beginverse
Oh, the Antelope shook and pitched on her side
    ("How I wish I was in Sherbrook now!")
Oh Barrett was smashed like a bowl of eggs
And the Maintruck carried off both me legs.
\endverse
\beginverse
So here I sit in my twenty-third year
    ("How I wish I was in Sherbrook now!")
It's been six years since I sailed away 
And I just made Halifax yesterday 
\endverse
