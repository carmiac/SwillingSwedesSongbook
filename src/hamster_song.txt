\beginverse
Fighting hamsters from the sky
Some will live and some will die
Hamsters have nothing to fear
The fighting hamsters of Calontir
\endverse
\beginverse
Silver tape upon their backs
A broadsword is all they lack
Fifty hamsters fight a war
They won't win without fifty more
\endverse
\beginverse
Trained by jumping off a roof
Trained in combat tooth to tooth
Hamsters fight both far and near
The fighting hamsters of Calontir
\endverse
\beginverse
Riding high upon our helms
Their war cry it overwhelms
All opponents become weak
At their fearsome squeaky squeak
\endverse
\beginverse
Back at home Paval waits
His fighting hamster has met its fate
He has died while drinking beer
The fighting hamsters of Calontir
\endverse
\beginverse
Once again its off to war
This time we number a dozen more
We will fight for those in need
so this year it's with Caid
\endverse
\beginverse
Fighting hamsters jump from planes
Fighting hamsters fall like rain
Some will live but most will die
Stupid creatures cannot fly 
\endverse
