\beginsong{Sister's Lullaby}
\beginverse
Hush and sleep ye,
Shush and keep ye,
Safe within the home's strong walls
Naught shall harm ye,
We shall charm ye,
With the songs the night bird call.
Sisters strong shall keep the cradle,
Sisters long shall watch the war
Sisters all shall guard and guide ye,
Till ye wake at break of dawn. 
\endverse
\beginverse
Hush and sleep ye,
Shush and keep ye,
Alta watches from above
We will praise ye,
We will raise ye,
Light and darkin Alta's love.
Sisters strong shall keep the cradle,
Sisters long shall watch the war
Sisters all shall guard and guide ye,
Till ye wake at break of dawn. 
\endverse
