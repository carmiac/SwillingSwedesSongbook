A doleful damsel I heard cry;

Where are the legs that used to run?
When first you learned to carry a gun
I fear your dancing days are done
\endverse

Where are the eyes that were so mild?
That looked upon the world and smiled
Why did you leave your wife and child?
\endverse

You haven't an arm, you haven't a leg
You're a boneless, eyeless, chickenless egg
We'll have to put you out with a bowl to beg

We're happy for to see you home
All from the island of Ceylon
So low in the flesh, so high in the bone 
\endverse
