\beginverse
The sexual life of the Camel
Is stranger than anyone thinks
One night in a moment of passion 
He tried to deflower the Sphinx!
\endverse
\beginverse
Now, the Sphinx's posterior anatomy
Is covered with sand from the Nile.
That accounts for the hump in the Camel,
And the Sphinx's inscrutable smile! 
\endverse
\beginverse
The One skin lies over the Two skin 
The Two skin lies over the Three 
The Three skin lies over the Foreskin 
Please roll back my Foreskin for me 
\endverse
\beginverse
The Baron, he rides on a warhorse, 
With a fancy great helluva rig, 
He doesn't get there any faster, 
But it makes the old bastard feel big! 
\endverse
\beginverse
The King, he sleeps in a feather bed 
The Knights all sleep in their sacks; 
As a means of self-preservation, 
The squires all sleep on their backs! 
\endverse
\beginverse
And here's to the girls of St Golias 
And here's to the alleys they roam, 
And here's to their dirty-faced bastards, 
God bless 'em, they may be your own! 
\endverse
