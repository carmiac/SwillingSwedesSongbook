\beginverse
Dumbarton's drums, they sound so bonnie
When they remind me of my Johnny
What fond delight can steal upon me
when Johnny kneels and kisses me
\endverse
\beginverse
Across the fields of bounding heather
Dumbarton tolls the hour of pleasure
a song of love that has no measure
When Johnny kneels and sings to me
\endverse
\beginverse
Tis he alone that can delight me
His graceful eye, it doth invite me
And when his tender arms enfold me
The blackest night doth turn and dee
\endverse
\beginverse
My love he is a handsome laddie
And tho he is Dumbarton's caddie
Someday I'll be a captain's lady
When Johnny tends his vows to me
\endverse
