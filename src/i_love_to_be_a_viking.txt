\beginsong{I Love to be a Viking}[tune = {Vietnam Song by Country Joe And The Fish}]
\beginverse
Well, come on Viking, don't be lax  
put on your tunic and grab your ax  
We're goin' down to our dragon ships  
gonna skewer some Saxons on our spear-tips  
We know we won't all be comin' back,  
but it's so fun to slash and hack! 
\endverse
\beginchorus
And it's 1-2-3, who are fightin' for? 
I know, it don't matter at all, 
next stop is Odin's hall! 
And it's 5-6-7, headin' for the rainbow bridge, 
well, we love to fight, and that's no lie, 
whoopee, we're all gonna die! 
\endchorus
\beginverse
Well we know dyin' ain't so tough,  
that's what makes us so mean and rough  
We know that when we kick off  
we'll be drinkin' good beer right out of a trough  
And grabbin' Valkyries by their bums  
and the hangover never comes! 
\endverse
\beginverse
So, you grab Oly and I'll get Sven  
the spring is here, it's time to raid again  
Let's steal the cattle and burn the huts  
and toss the women right on their butt's!  
And we'll have a good time and maybe we'll croak,  
but who cares, let's go make some smoke! 
\endverse
\beginverse
Well, Vikings are bad boys to the core 
even our poems are full of gore  
We like squishing intestines with our feet  
we think slaughter is really neat!  
Because fightin' and killin' pleases our gods,  
so hey, you can't beat the odds!
