\beginsong{Ballynure Ballad}
\beginverse
As I was goin’ to Ballynure,
The day I will remember,
For to view the lads and lasses on
The fifth day of November,
\endverse
\beginchorus
With a ma-ring-doo-a-day,
With a ma-ring-a-doo-a-daddy oh!
\endchorus
\beginverse
As I was goin’ along the road
When homeward I was walking.
I hear a wee lad behind a ditch-a
To his wee lass was talking,
\endverse
\beginverse
Said the wee lad to the wee lass,
"It’s will ye let me kiss ye,
For it’s I have got the cordial eye
That far exceeds the whiskey."
\endverse
\beginverse
This cordial that ye talk about
There’s very few o’ them gets it,
For there’s nothin’ now but crooked combs
And muslin gowns can catch it.
\endverse
