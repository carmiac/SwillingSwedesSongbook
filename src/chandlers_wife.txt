\beginsong{The Chandlers Wife}
\beginverse
I went into the chandlers shop, some candles for to buy
I looked around the chandlers shop, but none did I spy
I was disappointed, so some angry words I said;
Then I heard the sound of a (knock, knock, knock)
up above my head
Oh, I heard the sound of a (knock, knock, knock)
Up above my head
\endverse
\beginverse
Well I was slick, and I was quick, and up the stairs I sped,
And quite suprised was I to find the chandlers wife in bed
And with her was a gentleman of quite enormous size
and they were having a (knock, knock, knock)
Right before my eyes
Yes they were having a (knock, knock, knock)
Right before my eyes
\endverse
\beginverse
When the fun was over and done, and the lady raised her head
Quite surprised was she to find me standing by her bed
"If you will be discreet my lad, if you will be so kind
You too can come up for some (knock, knock, knock)
Whenever you feel inclined
Yes, you too can come up for some (knock, knock, knock)
Whenever you feel inclined"
\endverse
\beginverse
So many a night and many a day, when the chandler wasn't home
To get myself some candles, to the chandlers shop I'd roam
But nary a one she gave me, she'd give to me instead
Just a little bit more of that (knock, knock, knock)
To light my way to bed
Just a little bit more of that (knock, knock, knock)
To light my way to bed
\endverse
\beginverse
Now all you married men take heed, if ever you go to town
If you must leave your wife at home, be sure to tie her down
Or if you be so kind to her, just set her down there on the floor
And give her so much of that (knock, knock, knock)
She doesn't want any more
Just give her so much of that (knock, knock, knock)
She doesn't want any more 
\endverse
