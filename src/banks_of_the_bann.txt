\beginsong{The Banks of the Bann}[by={Traditional}]
\beginverse
When first unto this country a stranger I came
I placed my affections on a maid that was young
She bein' young and tender, Her waist small an' slender
Kind nature had formed her for my overthrow
\endverse
\beginverse
On the banks of the Bann is where I first beheld her
She appeared like Regina, the fair Grecian Queen
Her eyes shone like diamonds, or stars softly shinin'
Her lips were like roses, or blood drops on snow
\endverse
\beginverse
It was her cruel parents, who first caused her variance
Because she was rich, and above my degree
But I'll do my endeavor, to gain my loves favor
Although she is born of a high family
\endverse
\beginverse
My name it is Delahney, that's a name that won't chain me
If I ha' had money, I'd ha' never had room
But the drinkin' an' sportin', an ramblin' an' courtin'
Are the cause of all my ruin and absence from home
\endverse
\beginverse
But now that I have gained her, I am happy forever
With rings on her finger, and gold in her hair
And now by the banks of the lovely Bann waters
In peace and contentment I'll live with my dear 
\endverse
