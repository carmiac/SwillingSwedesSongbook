\beginverse
There is an ancient party at the other end of town
He keeps a little grocery store, and the ancient's name is Brown
He has a lovely daughter, such a treat I never saw
Oh, I only hope someday to be the old man's son-in-law
\endverse
\beginverse
Old Brown sells from off his shelf most anything you please
He's got juice hops for the little boys, lollipops and cheese
His daughter minds the store and it's a treat to see her serve
I'd like to run away with her but I don't have the nerve
\endverse
\beginchorus
And it's Old Brown's daughter is a proper sort of girl
Old Brown's daughter is as fair as any pearl
I wish I was a Lord, Mayor, Marquis or an Earl
And blow me if I wouldn't marry Old Brown's girl
Blow me if I wouldn't marry Old Brown's girl
\endchorus
\beginverse
Well poor Old Brown now has trouble with the gout
He grumbles in his little parlour when he can't get out
And when I make a purchase, Lord, and she hands me the change...
That girl she makes me pulverized, I feel so very strange
\endverse
\textnote{Chorus}
\beginverse
Miss Brown, she smiles so sweetly when I say a tender word
Oh, but Old Brown says that she must wed a Marquis or a Lord
And I don't suppose it's ever one of those things I will be...
But, by jingo, next election I will run for Trinity!
\endverse
