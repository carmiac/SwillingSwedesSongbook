\beginsong{Paisteen Fionn}[index = {The Fair Haired Child}]
\beginverse
My Paisteen Fionn is my soul's delight
Her heart laughs out in her blue eyes bright,
The bloom of the apple her bossom white,
Her neck like the March swan's in whiteness
\endverse
\beginverse
Oh you are my dear, my dear, my dear;
Oh! You are my dear and my fair love!
You are my own dear and my fondest hope here,
And oh that my cottage you'd share, love.
\endverse
\beginverse
Love of my bosom, my fair Paisteen,
Whose cheek is red like the roses' sheen;
My thoughts of the maiden are pure, I ween,
Save toasting her health in my lightness!
\endverse
\beginverse
Oh you are my dear, my dear, my dear;
Oh! You are my dear and my fair love!
You are my own dear and my fondest hope here,
And oh that my cottage you'd share, love.
\endverse
\beginverse
From kinsfolk and friends, my fair, I'd flee
From all the beautiful maids that be;
But I'll never leave you sweet gramachree,
Till death in your service o'er takes me!
\endverse
\beginverse
Oh you are my dear, my dear, my dear;
Oh! You are my dear and my fair love!
You are my own dear and my fondest hope here,
And oh that my cottage you'd share, love.
