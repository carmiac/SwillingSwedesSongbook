\beginsong{A Cautionary Tale}[
  by={Adellind le Quintain},
  tune={Red is the Rose}]
\beginverse
Well, come sit ye down, and I'll tell you a tale
It concerns what goes on 'tween lads and lasses
'tis a good thing to learn for any canny lass
And when I am done you will thank me.
\endverse
\beginchorus
Red is yer nose as on yer face it grows
And red is me face as I sit here
And red is the hand does the spankin' in this land
But my arse is redder than any!
\endchorus
\beginverse
"Now come to the bed, me bonnie little wife,
And we'll have a bit of slap-and-tickle.
And willing I went and well was I served
But 'twas then that I made my great blunder.
\endverse
\beginverse
"Oh, Johnnie, my love, your lovin' has no peer"
and truer words were never spoken
But Robbie's the name of my duly wedded lord
And John is the name of my lover.
\endverse
\beginchorus
Red is yer nose as on yer face it grows
And red is me face as I sit here
And red is the hand does the spankin' in this land
But my arse is redder than any!
\endchorus
\beginverse
Then up from the bed, me husband bolted up
And great was his rage as he shouted,
"Now how is it, wife that ye call another's name,
When I should be all that ye think of?"
\endverse
\beginverse
My tale now is done, as I shift from cheek to cheek
The lesson I learned is quite simple;
If ye canna hold your tongue when ye're lyin' with a man,
'Tis best ye remain ever faithful! 
\endverse
\beginchorus
Red is yer nose as on yer face it grows
And red is me face as I sit here
And red is the hand does the spankin' in this land
But my arse is redder than any!
\endchorus
