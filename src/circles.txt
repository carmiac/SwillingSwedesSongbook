\beginverse
In the days gone by, when the world was much younger,
men wondered at spring, born of winter's cold knife.
Wondering at the games of the moon and the sunlight
they saw there the lady and lord of all life.
\endverse
\beginchorus
And around, and around, and around turns the good earth,
all things must change as the seasons go by.
We are the children of the lord and the lady
whose mysteries we know, yet will never know why,
\endchorus
\beginverse
In all lands the people were tied with the good earth
plowing and sowing, as the seasons declared,
waiting to reap of the rich golden harvest,
knowing her laugh in the joys that they shared.
\endverse
\beginverse
Through Flanders and Wales and the green lands of Ireland,
in the kingdoms of England and Scotland and Spain;
circles grew up all along the wild coastlines,
and worked for the land with the sun and the rain.
\endverse
\beginverse
Circles for healing and working the weather,
Circles for knowing the moon and the sun,
Circles for thanking the lord and the lady,
Circles for dancing the dance never done.
\endverse
\beginverse
And we who reach for the stars in the heavens,
turning our eyes form the meadows and groves
still live in the love of the lord and the lady:
the greater the circle, the more the love grows. 
\endverse
