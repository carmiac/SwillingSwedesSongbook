\beginsong{Come All Ye Fair and Tender Ladies}
\beginverse
Come all ye fair and tender ladies,
Take warnin' how you court young men.
They're like a star on a summers morning.
First they'll appear then they're gone.
\endverse
\beginverse
They'll tell to you some loving story.
And they'll declare their love is true.
Straight way they'll go and court some other,
And that's the love they have for you.
\endverse
\beginverse
O, Don't you remember our days of courtin',
When your head lay upon my breast?
You could make me believe by the falling of your arm,
That the sun rose in the west.
\endverse
\beginverse
If I had known before I courted,
That love had been so hard to win;
I'd have locked my heart in a box of golden,
And fastened it up with a silver pin.
\endverse
\beginverse
I wish I were a little sparrow,
And I had wings, and I could fly;
I'd fly away to my false true lover,
And when he'd speak I would deny.
\endverse
\beginverse
But I am not a little sparrow.
I have no wings, nor can I fly.
I will sit right down in grief and sorrow,
And try to pass my troubles by. 
\endverse
