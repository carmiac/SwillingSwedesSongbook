\beginsong{Four and Twenty Virgins}[index = {Ballad of Inverness}]
\beginverse
Four and twenty virgins came down from Inverness
And when they went back home again they were four and twenty less
\endverse
\beginchorus
Singin' balls to your partner
Ass against the wall
If ya canna' get laid on a Saturday night (In the SCA, At [Name of Event], etc.)
Ya canna' get laid at all
\endchorus
\beginverse
The village idiot he was there, now what do you think of that?
Amusin' himself while abusin' himself, and catchin' it in his hat
\endverse
\beginverse
The village whore now she was there, a layin' on the floor
And every time she opened her legs the suction closed the door
\endverse
\beginverse
The village vicar now he was there, a-gettin' drunk and loud
He was swingin' from the ceiling while pissin' on the crowd
\endverse
\beginverse
The village baker he was there, so drunk he began to scream
He grabbed the girls like great big tarts and pumped them full of cream
\endverse
\beginverse
The village potter he was there, he made a dong of clay
He sat the girls upon the wheel and gave them all a lay
\endverse
\beginverse
The village rabbi he was there, treatin' a knife like a toy
He swung and swished and he took an inch off every man and boy
\endverse
\beginverse
The village acrobat he was there, a' screwin' on the stair
The bannister broke, he doubled his stroke and finished her off in midair
\endverse
\beginverse
The village postman he was there, the poor man had the pox
He couldn't get a piece inside, so he screwed his own mailbox
\endverse
\beginverse
The village hunter he was there, polishin' his gun with skill
Four girls were all barin' their asses, waitin' for the kill
\endverse
\beginverse
The village fool now he was there, he had an amazin' lack of wits
For every time a girl would pass, he'd just drool on her tits
\endverse
\beginverse
The village virgin she was there, the poor girl got a scare
But from under her dress she heard a voice "It's only my tongue up there!"
\endverse
\beginverse
The village swordsman he was there, he had a rod like a train
And when he rammed an ass they cried, "My god he impaled my brain"
\endverse
\beginverse
The village constable he was there, a-twirlin' his billy stick
Surprised were all the girls to find it was really a twelve inch prick
\endverse
\beginverse
The village maiden now she was there, a clingin' to her dress
Bein' chased by a hoard of horny priests, her sins they would confess
\endverse
\beginverse
The village nun she was there, great stains upon her habit
That was because she spent the night screwin' like a rabbit 
\endverse
