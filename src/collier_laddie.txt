\beginsong{The Collier Laddie}
\beginverse
Oh, I've been east and I've been west,
And I've been to Kirkcaldy;
But the bonniest lassie that ever I saw,
She was following a collier laddie.
\endverse
\beginverse
" Oh where live ye my bonnie lass?
And tell me what they ca'ye?"
" Bonnier Jeanie Gordon is my name,
And I'm following my Collier laddie."
\endverse
\beginverse
" O, see ye not yon hills and dales
The sun shines on saw brawlie;
They a'are mine, and they'll be thine,
Gin ye'll leave your collier laddie.
\endverse
\beginverse
And ye shall bask in gay attire,
Weel busket up sae brawlie;
And ane to wait on ev'ry hand,
Gin ye'll leave your collier laddie.:
\endverse
\beginverse
" Tho ye had a the sun shines on,
And the earth conceals sae lowly,
I would turn my back on you and it a',
And embrace my collier laddie.
\endverse
\beginverse
O, I can win my five pennies a day,
And spend at night fu'brawlie;
And make my bed in the collier's neuk,
And lie doon wi'my collier laddie."
\endverse
\beginverse
O, love for love's the bargain for me,
Tho the wee cot house should haud me;
And the world before me to win my bread,
And fair fa'my collier laddie."
Come all ye fair and tender ladies 
\endverse
