\beginverse
There is a young maiden who lives all alone
She lives all alone on the shore-o
There's nothing she can find to comfort her mind
But to roam all alone on the shore shore shore
But to roam all alone on the shore
\endverse
\beginverse
T'was of the young captain who sailed the salt sea
Let the wind blow high blow low-o
I will die, I will die the young captain did cry
If I don't have that maid on the shore shore shore
If I don't have that maid on the shore
\endverse
\beginverse
Well I have lots of silver I have lots of gold
I have lots of costly ware-o
I'll divide, I'll divide with my jolly ship's crew
If they row me that maid on the shore shore shore
If they row me that maid on the shore
\endverse
\beginverse
After much persuasion they got her aboard
Let the wind blow high blow low-o
They replaced her away in his cabin below
Here's adieu to all sorrow and care care care
Here's adieu to all sorrow and care
\endverse
\beginverse
They replaced her away in his cabin below
Let the wind blow high blow low-o
She's so pretty and neat she's so sweet and complete
She sung captain and sailors to sleep sleep sleep
She sung captain and sailors to sleep
\endverse
\beginverse
Then she robbed him of silver she robbed him of gold
She robbed him of costly ware-o
Then took his broadsword instead of an oar
And paddled away to the shore shore shore
And paddled away to the shore
\endverse
\beginverse
Well me men must be crazy me men must be mad
Me men must deep in despair-o
For to let you away from my cabin so gay
And to paddle your way to the shore shore shore
And paddle your way to the shore
\endverse
\beginverse
Well your men was not crazy your men was not mad
Your men was not deep in despair-o
I deluded your sailors as well as yourself
I'm a maiden again on the shore shore shore
I'm a maiden again on the shore
\endverse
