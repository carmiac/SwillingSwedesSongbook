\beginsong{Belfast Mill}
\beginverse
On the east end of town, by the foot of the hill
There's a chimney so tall, says Belfast Mill
But there's no smoke at all comin' out of the stack
For the mill has shut down, and it's never comin' back
\endverse
\beginchorus
And the only tune I hear is the sound of the wind
As she blows through the town, we then spin, we then spin
\endchorus
\beginverse
There's no children playin' down the dark lonely streets
For the mill has shut down, so quiet I can't sleep
\endverse
\beginverse
The mill has shut down, 'twas the only life I know
Tell me where will I go, tell me where will I go
\endverse
\beginverse
Well I'm to old to work, and I'm too young to die
Tell me where will I go, my family and I
\endverse
\beginverse
At the east end of town, by the foot of the hill
There's a chimney so tall, says Belfast Mill
But there's no smoke at all comin' out of the stack
For the mill has shut down, and it's never comin' back 
\endverse
