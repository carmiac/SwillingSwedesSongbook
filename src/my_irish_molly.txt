\beginsong{My Irish Molly-O}
\beginverse
Molly dear now did you hear, the news that's goin' round?
Down in a corner of my heart, a love is what you've found. And
Every time I look into your Irish eyes so blue. They
seem to whisper 'Darling boy, my love is all for you.' Oh,
\endverse
\beginchorus
Molly, my Irish Molly, my sweet acushla
dear I'm fairly off my trolley, my Irish
Molly, When you are near. Springtime, you know is
ring time. Come dear and don't be slow,
Change your name, go out with game,
Begora wouldn't I do the same
my Irish Molly O!
\endchorus
\beginverse
Molly dear now did you hear I furnished up the flat.
Three little cozy rooms with bath and a 'welcome' on the mat.
It's five pounds down and two a week, we'll soon be out of debt.
It's all complete except, they haven't brought the cradle yet.
\endverse
\beginverse
Molly dear now did you hear what all the neighbors say.
About the hundred sovereigns you have safely stowed away.
They say that's why I love you. Ah but Molly that's a shame
If you had only ninety-nine I'd love you just the same.
\endverse
