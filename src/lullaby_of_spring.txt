\beginsong{Lullaby of Spring}
\beginverse
Rain has showered far her drip
Splash and trickle running 
Plant has flowered in the sun
Shell and pebble sunning 
\endverse
\beginchorus
So begins another spring
Green leaves and of berries
Chiff-chaff eggs are painted by
Mother-bird eating cherries 
\endchorus
\beginverse
In a misty tangled sky
Fast a wind is blowing
In a newborn rabbit's heart
River life is flowing 
\endverse
\beginverse
From the dark and whetted soil
Petals are unfolding
From the stony village kirk
Easter bells of old rings 
\endverse
