Beauty in child hood blows, Eileen Aroon
When like a diadem Buds blush around the stem
Which is the fairest gem Eileen Aroon.

I know a valley fair, Eileen Aroon
I know a cottage there, Eileen Aroon
Far in the valley shade I know a tender maid
Flow'r of the hazel glade, Eileen Aroon.

Who in the song so sweet, Eileen Aroon
Who in the dance so fleet, Eileen Aroon

Dearest her constancy, Eileen Aroon.

Beauty must fade away, Eileen Aroon

Truth is a fixed star, Eileen Aroon.
