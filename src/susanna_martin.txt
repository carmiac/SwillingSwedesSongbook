\beginsong{Susanna Martin}[
    by={Traditional},

\beginverse
Susanna Martin was a witch who dwelt in Amesbury
With brilliant eye and saucy tongue she worked her sorcery
And when into the judges court the sheriffs brought her hither
The lilacs drooped as she passed by
And then were seen to wither
\endverse
\beginverse
A witch she was, though trim and neat with comely head held high
It did not seem that one as she with Satan so would vie
And when in court when the afflicted ones proclaimed her evil ways
She laughed aloud and boldly then
Met Cotton Mathers gaze
\endverse
\beginverse
"Who hath bewitched these maids," he asked, and strong was her reply
"If they be dealing in black arts, ye know as well as I"
And then the stricken ones made moan as she approached near
They saw her shaped upon the beam
So none could doubt 'twas there
\endverse
\beginverse
The neighbors 'round swore to the truth of her Satanic powers
That she could fly o'er land and stream and come dry shod through
showers
At night, twas said, she had appeared a cat of fearsome mien
"Avoid she-devil,"they had cried
To keep their spirits clean
\endverse
\beginverse
The spectral evidence was weighed, then stern the parson spoke
"Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live, tis written in the Book"
Susanna Martin so accused, spoke with flaming eyes
"I scorn these things for they are naught
But filthy gossips lies"
\endverse
\beginverse
Now those bewitched, they cried her out, and loud their voice did ring
they saw a bird above her head, an evil yellow thing
And so, beneath a summer sky, Susanna Martin died
And still in scorn she faced the rope
Her comely head held high
\endverse
