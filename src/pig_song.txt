\beginsong{The Pig Song}[by={Modern Traditional}]
\beginverse
It was early last December, as near as I remember
Oh I staggered down the street and tipsy cried
No one I was disturbing, as I lay down by the curbing
And then a pig came up and lay down by my side
\endverse
\beginverse
As I lay there by the gutter, thinking thoughts I cannot ...Utter
A Lady passing by was heard to say...
\textnote{Spoken}
*Hmmmmm. Well, well, well*
\textnote{Sung}
You can tell a man who boozes, by the company he chooses
And then the pig got up and slowly walked away 
\endverse
