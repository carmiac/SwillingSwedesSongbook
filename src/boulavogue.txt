\beginsong{Boulavogue}[by={P.J.~McCall}]
\beginverse
At Boulavogue, as the sun was setting
O'er the bright May meadows of Shalmaleer
A rebel hand set the heather blazing
And brought the neighbors from far and near.
\endverse
\beginverse
Then Father Murphy, from old Kilcormac,
Spurred up the rocks with a warning cry.
"Arm, Arm." He cried, "For I've come to lead you
For Ireland's freedom we'll fight or die."
\endverse
\beginverse
He leads us on 'gains the coming soldiers,
The cowardly yeomen we put to flight.
'Twas at the Hara, the boys of Wexford showed
Bougie's regiment old men could fight.
\endverse
\beginverse
Look out for hirelings King George of England,
Search every Kingdom that breeds a slave
For Father Murphy, from County Wexford,
Sweeps o'er the land like a mighty wave.
\endverse
\beginverse
At Vinegar Hill o'er the Pleasant Slane,
Our heroes banely stood back to back.
And the Youls at Tulla took Father Murphy
And burned his body upon the rack.
\endverse
\beginverse
God grant you glory Father Murphy
And open heaven to all your men,
For the cause that called you,
May call tomorrow in another fight for the green again.
\endverse
