\beginverse
To oar, to oar, the helmsman did cry 
We're close to the shore and the tides running high 
There's gold in this place and we're willing to try 
And the gods would favor the bold 
These Irish will flee as we come from the sea 
Aye the Norsemen are sailing for gold 
The Norsemen are sailing for gold 
\endverse
\beginverse
To arms, to arms, the helmsman did say 
They've chosen to meet us in battle today 
They cannot withstand us, they'll soon run away 
And the gods would favor the brave 
So let fly the spear, there'll be slaughter here 
Aye the Norse have come over the waves 
The Norse have come over the waves 
\endverse
\beginverse
Stand firm, stand firm, the helmsman did shout 
Though many have fallen our hearts are still stout 
Should we retreat it would end in a rout 
And the gods would favor the strong 
So here we shall stand to the very last man 
Aye the Norse will remember our song 
The Norse will remember our song 
\endverse
\beginverse
Rise up, rise up, the Valkyries cry 
Odin appointed this day you would die 
Mount up on our horses, to Valhalla we fly 
And the gods still honor the brave 
Outnumbered you stood as a true hero would 
True Norsemen go such to their graves 
Norsemen go such to their graves 
\endverse
\beginverse
\textnote{OPTIONAL LAST VERSE}
No sound, no sound, save the rush of the sea 
The ravens are feeding, they won't feed on me 
For when our line broke, I hid in the trees 
And the gods have forgotten my name 
I cannot go home, forever I roam 
For the Norse would remember my shame 
The Norse will remember my shame 
\endverse
