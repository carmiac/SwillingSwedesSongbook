\beginsong{McPherson's Lament}[by={Irish Traditional}]
\beginverse
Farewell ye dungeons dark and strong.
Farewell, farewell to thee;
McPherson's life will not be long
On yonder gallows tree.
\endverse
\beginchorus
Sae rantingly, sae wantonly, and sae dauntingly gaed he;
He played a tune and he danced around below the gallows tree.
\endchorus
\beginverse
Take off these bands from off my hands
And give to me my sword,
For there's not a man in all Scotland
But I'd brave him at his word.
\endverse
\beginverse
There's some come here for to see me hung,
And some to buy my fiddle;
But before that I do part with her,
I'll break her through the middle
\endverse
\beginverse
He took his fiddle in both his hands,
And he broke it o'er a stove,
Saying, there's nay ither hand shall play on thee
When I am dead and gone.
\endverse
\beginverse
The reprieve was coming o'er the Brig of Baniff,
For to set McPherson free;
But they put the clock a quarter before,
And they hanged him from a tree.
\endverse
