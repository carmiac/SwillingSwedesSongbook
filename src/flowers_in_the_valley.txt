\beginsong{Flowers in the Valley}
\beginverse
There was a woman, oh but she was a widow
Fair as the flowers in the valley
With a daughter as fair as a fray sunny meadow
The red and the green and the yellow
\endverse
\beginchorus
No harp, no lute, nor pipe nor flute nor cymbal
As sweet grows the treble violin
\endchorus
\beginverse
This maiden so fair and the flower so rare
Together they grew in the valley
Oh, then came this knight all dressed in red
Fair as the flowers in the valley
"Thou art my bride", I'll say, "thou as thee said"
The red and the green and the yellow
\endverse
\beginverse
"Oh no" said she "Oh thou'st never win me"
As fair as the flowers in the valley
Oh, then came this knight all dressed in green
Fair as the flowers in the valley
"Thou must be, I see thou as my queen"
The red and the green and the yellow
\endverse
\beginverse
"Oh no" said she "Oh thou'st never win me"
As fair as the flowers in the valley
Oh, then came this knight all dressed in yellow
Fair as the flowers in the valley
"Thou art my love and my bride" said he
The red and the green and the yellow
\endverse
\beginchorus
"I'll come" said she "I'll go with thee"
Farewell to the flowers in the valley 
\endchorus
