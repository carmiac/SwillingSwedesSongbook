\beginverse
A grazing mace, how sweet the sound, that felled a foe for me
I bashed his head, he struck the ground, and thus came victory
\endverse
\beginverse
My mace has taught my foes to fear, that mace my fears relieved
How precious did my mace appear, when I my mace received
\endverse
\beginverse
Through many tourneys, wars, and fairs, I have already come
My mace has brought me safe so far, my mace will bring me home
\endverse
\beginverse
The King has promised good to me, His word my hope secures
I will his Shield and Weapon be, when He gives me my spurs
\endverse
\beginverse
And when my mace my foeman nails, that mortal strife shall cease
And we'll possess within our pale, a life of joy and peace
\endverse
\beginverse
A grazing mace, how sweet the sound, that flattened a wretch like thee
Whose head is flat, that once was round done in by my mace...And me!
\endverse
\beginverse
A grazing mace, how sweet the sound that smites a foe like thee
You're left there lying on the ground, you've left the field to me! 
\endverse
