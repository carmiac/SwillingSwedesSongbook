\beginverse
I stand here now before you 
A shy and modest man, 
A simple song to sing you 
As chivalry demands; 
But I find the place uncommon, 
Before a crowd to sing, 
For I am a simple 
Soldier of the king. 
\endverse
\beginverse
There are some among my siblings 
Who tell a wondrous tale 
Of brave deeds and maidens 
And heroes where they fell. 
Their stories are beguiling, 
And wisdom from them springs; 
And I am a simple 
Soldier of the king. 
\endverse
\beginverse
Others of my siblings, 
Their voices fill the night: 
Dancing tunes and fancy, 
Their songs of pure delight. 
But though my song is quiet, 
The words ring no less true: 
From my heart, eternal springs 
The love I have for you. 
\endverse
