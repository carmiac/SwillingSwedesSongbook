\beginsong{Black Widows in the Privy}[by={Keridwen on Mynydd Gwyadd}]
\beginverse
Everyone knows someone we’d be better off without,
But best not mention names for we don’t know who’s about
But why commit a murder and risk the fires of hell,
When black widows in the privy can do it just as well.
\endverse
\beginverse
Now poison’s good, and daggers, and arrows in the back,
And if you are really desperate you can try a front attack,
But are they really worthy of the risk of being caught
When black widows in the privy need not be bribed or bought?
\endverse
\beginverse
So if there’s one, of whom you wish most simply to be rid,
Just wait ‘til dark then point the way to where the widow’s hid,
\textnote{spoken:}"I think you'll find that this one is the best."
And black widows in the privy will gladly do the rest.
\endverse
