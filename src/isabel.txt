\beginverse
I lie in this cage in full public gaze
And I don't give a pin for all their scorn
For I've crowned my lover king
Ah, such glorious days I've seen
Give me a chance, I'd do it all again
Give me a chance, I'd do it all again
\endverse

Robbie my love, you've the heart of a dove
Only Scotland could raise such a man
On the wild mountain side
I have lain down by your side
In spite of bitter wind and freezing rain
In spite of bitter wind and freezing rain
\endverse

These soft southern dogs have never scaled the heights
They cower in their comfort secure
But he has dared it all
And he's risked the fearsome fall
Surely God will crown the brave and the sure
Surely God will crown the brave and the sure
\endverse
\beginverse
At proud Bannockburn their cringing hearts did turn
From his noble and daring campaign
I watched from a distant hill
And my heart flies with him still
Though my body may be caged and disdained
Though my body may be caged and disdained
\endverse
\beginverse
He's bold as a ram, he's gentle as a lamb
He's a man that could never be denied
He's generous and gay
But he's changeable as day
And for just one hour with him I'd gladly die
And for just one hour with him I'd gladly die 
\endverse
