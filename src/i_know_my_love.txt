\beginsong{I Know My Love}
\beginverse
I know my love by his way of walkin',
And I know my love by his way of talkin',
And I know my love dressed in a suit of blue,
And if my love leaves me, what shall I do? 
\endverse
\beginchorus
And still she cried, "I love him the best,
And a troubled mind sure can know no rest."
And still she cried, "Bonny boys are few,
And if my love leaves me, what shall I do?" 
\endchorus
\beginverse
There is a dance house in Maradyke
And there my true love goes every night.
He takes a strange one upon his knee
And don't you think now that vexes me! 
\endverse
\beginverse
If my love knew I could wash and wring,
If my love knew I could weave and spin,
I'd make a coat all of the finest kind,
But the want of money leaves me behind. 
\endverse
