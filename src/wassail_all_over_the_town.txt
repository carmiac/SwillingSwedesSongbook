\beginverse
Wassail and wassail all over the town,
The cup it is white and the ale it is brown;
The cup it is made of the good old ashen tree,
And so is our beer of the best barley.
To you a wassail!
Aye, and joy come to our jolly wassail.
\endverse
\beginverse
O maid, O maid, with your silver-headed pin,
Pray open the door and let us all in,
All for to fill our wassail-bowl and so away again.
To you a wassail!
Aye, and joy come to our jolly wassail.
\endverse
\beginverse
O maid, O maid, with your glove and your mace,
Pray come unto this door and show your pretty face,
For we are truly weary of standing in this place.
To you a wassail!
Aye, and joy come to our jolly wassail.
\endverse
\beginverse
O master and mistress, if you are so well pleased
Pray set all on your table your white bread and your cheese,
And put forth your roast beef, your porrops and your pies.
To you a wassail!
Aye, and joy come to our jolly wassail.
\endverse
\beginverse
O master and mistress, if we've done any harm,
Pray pull fast this door and let us pass along,
And give us hearty thanks for singing of our song.
To you a wassail!
Aye, and joy come to our jolly wassail.
