\beginsong{How the Court Goes On}[tune = {Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da - The Beatles}]
\beginverse
Wulf has a stall in the merchants' row,
Einhard's armor needs a duct tape patch,
Supper back in camp is ready to be cooked,
But it's been so long the breakfast eggs have hatched.
\endverse
\beginchorus
Ob la de, ob la da, obadia, La La How the court goes on
Ob la de, ob la da, obadia, La La How the court goes on
\endchorus
\beginverse
In a couple of years the presentation part is done,
And the corp laws will be discussed at length,
The populace is stifling yawns.
\endverse
\beginverse
Happy as a prisoner on the torture rack,
Trapped in court I sit with knotted knees,
I wish I'd come late so I could stand in back,
Because a privy run is needed desperately.
\endverse
\beginchorus
Ob la de, ob la da, obadia, La La How the court goes on
Ob la de, ob la da, obadia, La La How the court goes on
\endchorus
\beginverse
If you want some fun, stay out 'til court is done.
