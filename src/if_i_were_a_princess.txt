\beginsong{If I Were A Princess}[tune = {If I Were A Rich Man}]
\beginchorus
All day long I'd sit upon my throne,
Watching all the peasants carry on. Ha. 
\endchorus
\beginverse
If I were a princess- La Da Da Da Da Da etc.
There would be a dozen virile knights
Fighting for my favor and my song.
\endverse
\beginverse
They'd come to court and give me all sorts of presents
Trinkets and lovely things to eat.
Then they'd bow and curtsey when I pass by.
They'd work so hard to please me hoping that I would
Tell them that their lives were now complete.
But I'd just keep them groveling at my feet. Ha!
\endverse
\beginverse
But since I'm not a princess- La Da Da Da Da Da etc.
No one ever looks my way,
I'm the one who toils night and day
And I'll never hear the gentles say,
"Oh, your highness have a lovely day."
\endverse
