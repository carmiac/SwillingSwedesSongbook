\beginsong{Greensleeves II}[tune = {Greensleeves}]
\beginverse
Alas, my lady you've done me dirt
You`ve sewn green sleeves to my purple shirt
And then you've done me worse than that
You've made me go out and wear it 
\endverse
\beginchorus
Oh, Oh, what a dismal fate
To be seen at events in this terrible state
Oh, how I wish I could come late
Say, seven days/week/years after it's over 
\endchorus
\beginverse
Alas, my lady I'm born to lose
You've sewn pink bows to my purple shoes
You've done my hair up in waves and curls
My mother thinks I'm a girl
\endverse
\beginverse
Alas, my lady why did you think
My cloak would look nice in that shade of pink
You've decked me over in bobbins and lace
My costume's become a disgrace
\endverse
\beginverse
Alas, my lady I've been bereaved
Someone's just slandered my beautiful sleeve
He's questioned my taste in every way
My God, he said, I must be gay
\endverse
\beginverse
Alas, my lady you've done me wrong
You've made my tunic much too long
You've made it seven feet, ten inches, or more....
It drags across the floor! 
\endverse
