\beginverse
There were two sisters side by side,
Sing I dum and sing I day.
There were two sisters side by side,
The boys are bound for me.
There were two sisters side by side,
The eldest for young Johnny cried.
I'll be true unto my love, if he'll be true to me.
\endverse
\beginverse
Johnny bought the youngest a gay gold ring,
Sing I dum and sing I day.
Johnny bought the youngest a gay gold ring,
The boys are bound for me.
Johnny bought the youngest a gay gold ring,
He never bought the eldest a single thing.
I'll be true unto my love, if he'll be true to me.
\endverse
\beginverse
Johnny bought the youngest a beaver hat,
The eldest didn't think much of that.
\endverse
\beginverse
As they were a walkin' by the foamy brim,
The eldest pushed the youngest in.
\endverse
\beginverse
Sister, oh, sister give me thy hand,
And you can have Johnny and all his land.
\endverse
\beginverse
Oh, sister I'll not give you my hand,
And I'll have Johnny and all his land.
\endverse
\beginverse
So away she sank and away she swam,
Until she came to the miller's dam.
\endverse
\beginverse
The miller he took her gay gold ring,
And then he pushed her in again.
\endverse
\beginverse
The Miller he was hanged on the mountain head,
The eldest sister was burned and dead.
\endverse
