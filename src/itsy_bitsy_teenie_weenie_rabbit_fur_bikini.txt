An itsy bitsy teenie weenie little rabbit fur bikini
And in her apartment she wanted to stay!

On my shield, as my blazon, today!
An itsy bitsy teenie weenie little rabbit fur bikini
But "that's offensive" the Heralds all say!

I sat down at the Revel last evening
To a feast of green meat, and Rat Pie...
It was cold, and disgusting, and greasy
And I just want to upchuck and die!

It was an itsy bitsy teenie weenie little rabbit fur bikini
With a side dish of cold cabbage pie!
An itsy bitsy teenie weenie little rabbit fur bikini
With the fur on, and NOTHING inside!
