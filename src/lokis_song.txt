\beginsong{Loki's Song}[by={Mikal~Hrafspa}]
\beginverse
I was born in battle's fire
But when that storm god you all praise
Laid beside my mother's corpse
Walks the earth and shatters trees
\endverse
\beginverse
My toys the ravens of the field
You huddle close beside my gift
My lullabies the screams of horse
And whisper prayers beside the spit
And as the woodsmoke turns and twists
But when that storm god you all praise
You owe your lives to sly Loki.
\endverse
\beginverse
Walks the earth and shatters trees
You huddle close beside my gift
So sit beside the fires gleam
And whisper prayers beside the spit
And count the wrongs that I have borne
And as the woodsmoke turns and twists
I wait for Ragnarok and dream
You owe your lives to sly Loki.
\endverse
\textnote{Hark! Is that the battles horn?}
\beginverse
Odin saw me on the field
And recognized his bastard son
There he claimed me for his own
Heir to all that he had won
\endverse
\beginverse
But when that storm god you all praise
Walks the earth and shatters trees
You huddle close beside my gift
And whisper prayers beside the spit
And as the woodsmoke turns and twists
You owe your lives to sly Loki.
\endverse
\beginverse
I am the slyest of the gods
Fire is the gift I gave
I am swifter than the wind
And none can match the tricks I've played
\endverse
\beginverse
But when that storm god you all praise
Walks the earth and shatters trees
You huddle close beside my gift
And whisper prayers beside the spit
And as the woodsmoke, turns and twists
You owe your lives to sly Loki.
\endverse
\beginverse
What is the honor they give me?
Denied a seat in Odin's hall
Forbidden fruits from Idun's tree
And cast outside of Asgard's walls 
\endverse
