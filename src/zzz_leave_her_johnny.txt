\beginverse
I thought I heard the old man say
"Leave her, Johnny, leave her
It's a long, hard pull to the next payday
And it's time for us to leave her"
\endverse
\beginchorus
Leave her, Johnny, leave her!
Oh, leave her, Johnny, leave her
For the voyage is done and the winds don't blow
And it's time for us to leave her!
\endchorus
\beginverse
Oh, the winds were foul and the work was hard
Leave her, Johnny, leave her!
From the Liverpool dock to the London yard
And it's time for us to leave her
\endverse
\beginverse 
Oh, the skipper was bad, but the mate was worse
Leave her, Johnny, leave her
He'd blow you down with a spike and a curse
And it's time for us to leave her
\endverse
\beginverse
It was rotten meat and moldy bread
Leave her, Johnny, leave her!
You'd eat it or you'd starve to death
And it's time for us to leave her
\endverse
\beginverse
Well it's time for us to say goodbye
Leave her, Johnny, leave her
For now those pumps are all pumped dry
And it's time for us to leave her
\endverse
