\beginsong{The Harp That Once Through Tara's Halls}
\beginverse
The harp that once though Tara's halls, the soul of music shed,
now hangs as mute on Tara's walls as if that soul were fled.
So speaks the pride of former days, so glory's thrill is o'er
and hearts that one beat high for praise, now feel that pulse no more. 
\endverse
\beginverse
No more to chiefs and ladies bright the harp of Tara swells.
The chord alone that breaks at night its tale of ruin tells.
Thus freedom now so seldom wakes the only throb she gives,
is when some heart indignant breaks, to show that still she lives. 
\endverse
