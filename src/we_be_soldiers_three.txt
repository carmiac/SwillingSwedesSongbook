We be soldiers three,
Pardonnez-moi je vous en prie,
Lately come forth of the low country,
With never a penny of money.

Here, good fellow, I drink to thee,
Pardonnez-moi je vous en prie
To all good fellows wherever they be,
With never a penny of money.

And he that will not pledge me this,
Pardonnez-moi je vous en prie,
Pays for the shot, whatever it is,
With never a penny of money.

Charge it again, boys, charge it again,
Pardonnez-moi je vous en prie,
As long as you have any ink in your pen,
With never a penny of money.
