\beginsong{The Castle of Dromore}
\beginverse
October winds lament around the castle of Dromore
Yet peace is in her lofty halls, my loving treasure store
Though autumn leaves may droop and die, a bud of spring are you
\endverse
\beginchorus
Sing hushabye loo, low loo, low lan
Hushabye loo, low loo
\endchorus
\beginverse
Dread spirits all of black water, Clan Owen's wild banshee
Bring no ill wind to him nor us, my helpless babe and me
And Holy Mary pitying us to Heaven for grace doth sue
\endverse
\beginverse
Take time to thrive, my ray of hope, in the garden of Dromore
Take heed, young eaglet, till thy wings are feathered fit to soar
A little rest and then the world is full of work to do
A little rest and then the world is full of work to do 
\endverse
