\beginsong{The Devil and the Farmers Wife}
\beginverse
There was an old farmer and he lived on a hill;
If he ain't moved away, he's a livin' there still. 
\endverse
\beginchorus
Sing hi diddle I diddle I fye,
Diddle I diddle I day. 
\endchorus
\beginverse
The devil he came to the farmer one day,
Says, "One of your family I'm takin' away." 
\endverse
\beginverse
"O, please don't take my eldest son,
There's work on the farm that's got to be done."
\endverse
\beginverse
"Take my wife with the joy of my heart,
And I hope by golly that you never part."
\endverse
\beginverse
The Devil put the old woman into a sack,
And down the road went clickety clack.
\endverse
\beginverse
And when they got to the fork of the road,
He says, "Old woman, you're a hell of a load."
\endverse
\beginverse
And when they got to the gates of Hell,
He said, "Stoke up the fire, boys, we'll roast her well."
\endverse
\beginverse
Then up stepp'd a devil with ball and chain;
She upped with her foot and kicked out his brain.
\endverse
\beginverse
Then nine little devils went running up the wall,
Crying, "Take her back, Daddy, she'll murder us all."
\endverse
\beginverse
Well, the old man was peekin' through a crack,
When he seen the old Devil come a bringing' her back.
\endverse
\beginverse
"Here's your wife both sound and well,
If she'd stayed any longer she'd a torn up Hell."
\endverse
\beginverse
"I've been a devil most all of my life,
But I never knew what Hell was 'till I met with your wife."
\endverse
\beginverse
This proves that the women are better than the men,
They can all go to Hell and come back again. 
\endverse
