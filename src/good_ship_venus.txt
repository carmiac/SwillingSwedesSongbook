\beginverse
We sailed upon the good ship Venus
By Christ you should have seen us
The figurehead was a whore in bed
The mast an upright penis
\endverse
\beginverse
The Captain's name was Lugger
By Christ he was a bugger
He wasn't fit to shovel shit
From one ship to another
\endverse
\beginchorus
\textnote{Chorus every two verses}
Friggin' in the riggin'
Friggin' in the riggin'
Friggin' in the riggin'
There was fuck all else to do
\endchorus
\beginverse
The first mate's name was Cooper
By Christ, he was a trooper
He jerked and jerked until he worked
Himself into a stupor
\endverse
\beginverse
And the second mate was Andy
By Christ he had a dandy
Till they crushed his cock on a jagged rock
For cumming in the brandy
\endverse
\beginverse
The third mate's name was Morgan
By God he was a gorgon
Ten times a day sweet tunes he'd play
On his fuckin' organ
\endverse
\beginverse
Captains wife was Mabel
And by God was she able
To give the crew their daily screw
Upon the galley table
\endverse
\beginverse
The captain's daughter Charlotte
Was born and bred a harlot
Her thighs at night were lily white
By morning they were scarlet
\endverse
\beginverse
The cabin boy was Kipper
By Christ he was a nipper
He stuffed his ass with broken glass
And circumcised the skipper
\endverse
\beginverse
The captain's lovely daughter
Liked swimming in the water
Delighted squeals came when some eels
Found her sexual quarters
\endverse
\beginverse
When we reached our station
Through skillful navigation
The ship got sunk in a wave of spunk
From too much fornication
\endverse
\beginverse
On the good ship Venus
By Christ you should have seen us
The figurehead was a whore in bed
Sucking a dead man's penis
\endverse
