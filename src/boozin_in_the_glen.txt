\beginsong{Boozin' in the Glen}[tune = {Blowin' in the Wind}]
\beginverse
How many foes must a warrior mow down before he proves he's a man?
How many newbies must a white belt fall before he's knocked to the sand?
How many strikes must a rhino shrug off before they admit that one lands?
\endverse
\beginchorus
To tell you the truth my friend
I really do not care, cuz
I'm busy boozin' in the glen.
\endchorus
\beginverse
How many times must a site be dry but still require a fee?
How many times must a bard protest that wasn't me in the "yonder lee"?
How many gallons must Beerslayer hose before he flows to the sea?
\endverse
\beginverse
How many times must a man look up before he gets bombed in the eye?
How many years does one moron need before he understands bugger off and die?
How many folks will get puking drunk tonight while veterans just shake their heads and sigh?
\endverse
