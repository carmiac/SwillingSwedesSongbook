\beginverse
There once was a warrior
Fresh from the field
Kneeling before his king he came
When he had risen, he was a knight
and unto his king, this oath he gave.
\endverse
\beginchorus
I was born on the list field, I was raised in the war
And this day you did make me your knight
though some day my sword may grow rusty and old
I must live by my oath until I die
\endchorus
\beginverse
Great grew the knight, and his fame *he/she* did win
And never before a foe would yield
great were the numbers, he ne'er called defeat
and he sang this song behind his shield.
\endverse
\beginchorus
I was born on the list field, I was raised in the war
And one day my king made me a knight
Though some day my sword may grow rusty and old
I must live by my oath until I die.
\endchorus
\beginverse
Old grew the knight and retired to his farm
Said the king "You'll ne'er be called again."
This knight he knew honor and duty knew well
And unto his king this oath he gave.
\endverse
\beginchorus
I was born on the list field, I was raised in the war
And one day you did make me a knight
Though some day my sword may grow rusty and old
I must live by my oath until I die.
\endchorus
\beginverse
War tore the country and the king was in flight
His knights, they could not win the day
Onto the field rode that *old ag-ed/brave lady* knight
and some swear they heard him say.
\endverse
\beginchorus
You were born on the list field, You were raised in the war
And one day they did make you all knights
Though some day your sword may grow rusty and old
You must live by my oaths until I die.
\endchorus
\beginverse
The king's men they rallied, and they slew all their foes
\textnote{slowly}
They began to count their hurt and dead.
They found that *ag-ed/lady* knight ringed round by slain foes
And unto his king this oath he gave.
\endverse
\beginchorus
I was born on the list field, I was raised in the war
And one day you did make me a knight
Though seems my sword has grown rusty and old
I have lived by my oath, now I die.
\textnote{return to normal speed}
\endchorus
\beginverse
Stands now the heir to that old aged knight
and to all the legacy he bore
with this sword of my own I know my duty well
And I have my own oath I swore
\endverse
\beginchorus
I was born on the list field, I was raised in the war
And it matters not if I'm a knight
Though you see my sword's not yet rusty or old
I must live by my oath 'till I die.
\endchorus
