\beginverse
The battlefield is silent the shadows growing long
Though I may view the sunset I'll not live to see the dawn
The trees have ceased to rustle, the birds no longer sing
All nature seems to wonder at the passing of a king
\endverse
\beginverse
And now you stand before me your father's flesh and blood
Begotten of my sinews on the woman that I loved
So difficult the birthing, the mother died that day
And now you stand before me to take my crown away
\endverse
\beginverse
The hour is fast approaching when you come into your own
When you take the ring and scepter and sit upon your throne
Before that fatal hour when we each must meet our fate
Pray gaze upon the royal crown and marvel at its weight
\endverse
\beginverse
This cap of burnished metal is the symbol of a land
Supporting all we cherish, the dreams for which we stand
The weight you'll find is nothing if you hold it in your hand
The burden of the crown begins the day you put it on
\endverse
\beginverse
See how the jewels sparkle as you gaze on it again
Each facet is a subject whose rights you must defend
Every point of light a burden you must shoulder with your own
And mighty is the burden of the man upon the throne
\endverse
\beginverse
The day is nearly ended, my limbs are growing cold
I feel the angels waiting to receive my passing soul
Keep well for me my kingdom, when my memory is dead
And forgive me for the burden I place upon your head!
\endverse
