\beginchorus
Westering home with a song in the air
Light of me eye and it's goodbye to care
Laughter and love are a welcoming there
Pride of me heart my own love
\endchorus
\beginverse
Tell me a tale of the Orient gay
Tell me of riches that come from Cathay
Ah but it's grand to be waken at day
And find oneself nearer to Isla
\endverse
\beginverse
Where are the folks like the folks of the west
Canty and couthy and kindly, our best
There I would hie me and there I would rest
At hame wi' my ain folks in Isla
\endverse
\beginverse
Now I'm at home and at home I do lay
Dreaming of riches that come from Cathay
I'll hop a good ship and be on my way
And bring back my fortune to Isla
\endverse
